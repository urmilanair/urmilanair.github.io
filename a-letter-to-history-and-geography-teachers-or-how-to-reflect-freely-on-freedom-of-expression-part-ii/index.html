<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This is my translation of an article on freedom of expression (Fr. <em>liberté d&rsquo;expression</em>) by sociologist and demographer François Héran. Composed as an address to history and geography teachers in France in the wake of the murder of Samuel Paty, the article was published on October 30, 2020 in <em>La Vie des Idées</em>, the online journal of the <em>Institut du Monde contemporain</em> of the <em>Collège de France</em>. This is the second part of my translation of the article. My thanks to Éditions La Découverte for their permission to publish this translation on my blog.</p>

<h3 id="blurb">Blurb</h3>
<p><strong>How does one teach freedom of expression? By teaching its history,
proposes François Héran, a history that is a lot less republican and a
lot more respectful of religious beliefs than one would imagine. Instead
of making it an absolute, it is time we recognized that the
conditions of its exercise unfold in particular times and places.</strong></p>

<h3 id="an-offensive-or-a-tolerant-freedom">An offensive or a tolerant freedom?</h3>
<p>But then what would you say to a student who points to Article 4 of the
<a href="https://www.elysee.fr/en/french-presidency/the-declaration-of-the-rights-of-man-and-of-the-citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</a>,
which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Liberty consists in being able to do anything that does not harm
others&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As political scientist Denis Ramond has emphasized (in two articles he
published in the journal <em>Raisons politiques</em>, dated <a href="https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_RAI_044_0097--freedom-of-expression-what-are-we.htm">April 2011</a>
and <a href="https://www.cairn.info/revue-raisons-politiques-2013-4-page-123.htm">April 2013</a>),
two opposed interpretations are possible here: this freedom may be
offensive or tolerant. In the offensive reading, which is that of the
European Court of Human Rights, every speech or image, even when
offensive, feeds public debate and therefore serves democracy. This
freedom would benefit everyone, including the offended minority. Such a
position is typically &ldquo;paternalist&rdquo;: the author of the affront knows
better than his victims what is good for them, and considers
that the injury will be erased by the extra illumination thus dispensed.
Taken to its limit, in this reading, the offended would have to thank the
offender for this wonderful lesson on freedom. This would include
the case in which the dispenser of the lesson is the head of a foreign
state. You will invite your students to illustrate the effects of this
theory with the aid of recent examples.</p>
<p>The other interpretation of the right to freedom of expression takes
seriously the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_principle">harm principle</a>, affirmed in
1789, and the principle of respect for belief, proposed in 1882 by Jules
Ferry and invoked in the <a href="https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/en/constitution-of-4-october-1958">French Constitution of 1958</a>.
This is a deeply pluralist interpretation. On the plurality of values,
your students will benefit from reading the philosopher Paul Ricœur. In an
interview with Anita Hocquard published in 1996 in <em>Éduquer, à quoi
bon ?</em> (translatable as &ldquo;Education, what is it good for?&quot;), Ricœur
states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We do not live in a state of general consensus on values that are like
fixed stars. That is one of modernity&rsquo;s aspects and is a point of no
return. We evolve in a society that is pluralist&ndash;religiously,
politically, morally and philosophically&ndash;where each one has only the
power of his or her word. Our world is no longer enchanted. Christianity
as a mass phenomenon is dead [&hellip;] and our convictions can no longer
rely on a secular arm to prevail [&hellip;] Preparing people to enter this
problematic universe seems to me to be the task of the modern educator.
The latter no longer has to transmit authoritarian content, but he or
she must help individuals to orient themselves within conflictual
situations, to master with courage a certain number of antinomies.&quot;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Ricœur then cites three examples of antinomies: the preservation of
each person&rsquo;s autonomy while entering a public space of debate;
belonging to a living tradition without excluding the presence of other
traditions; possessing personal convictions while practicing &ldquo;a tolerant
openness towards positions other than one&rsquo;s own.&rdquo; You will have to
explain to your students that pluralism for Ricœur is not a synonym for
relativism; it is a fundamental value of democracy.</p>
<p>How do we choose between these two visions of freedom of expression&mdash;as
charitable offense and as respect for the Other? One expedient has consisted
in reformulating the dilemma in psychological or moralistic terms: you
are &ldquo;courageous&rdquo; if you persist in offending the Other, and
&ldquo;cowardly&rdquo; in the opposite case. Teach your students not to
fall into such a crude semantic trap. Let us cease to divide the nation
by calling those who contradict us &ldquo;enemies of the Republic&rdquo; or &ldquo;enemies
of France.&rdquo; It is an unworthy manner of excluding them from the debate
and from the nation. Nobody owns the French Republic. We still have the
right to accord a minimum of consideration to believers and
non-believers without being accused of complaisance towards
murderers. The faithful Muslims who habitually divide the world into
believers and &ldquo;heathens&rdquo; will then have to draw their conclusions.
This is the mental revolution needed for them to be able to integrate into the nation. You will remind your students that the
<a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/udhr.pdf">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> affirms
the right to change one&rsquo;s religion or to cease to believe. This is why
Saudi Arabia has refused to sign it. And if an excessively Cartesian
student wonders why our secular Republic has such strong ties with the
Wahhabi Regime, it would be best to refer the question to the
education authority&rsquo;s <em>laïcité</em> unit.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="the-advice-of-paul-ricœur-to-educators">The advice of Paul Ricœur to educators</h3>
<p>A synonym frequently encountered for the so-called &ldquo;cowardice&rdquo; of those who dare to take
into account the existence of the Other is &ldquo;complaisance&rdquo; or &ldquo;compromised.&rdquo; In the interview cited above, Ricœur furnishes the
antidote to these sophisms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Compromise, far from being a weak idea, is, on the contrary, an
extremely strong one. There is mistrust with regard to compromise because
it is too often confused with being compromised. Being
compromised involves a perverse mingling of frameworks and guiding principles. There is no confusion in case of compromise as there is
in case of being compromised. In a compromise, each person rests
in his or her place, no one is stripped of his or her system of
justification.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lesson can be applied to the defamatory accusation of
&ldquo;complaisance&rdquo; towards jihadism or &ldquo;Islamo-leftism&rdquo;&mdash;the very type of
irrational formula of loathing that substitutes insult for analysis and
that has no place in democracy. To include the Other&rsquo;s existence in
one&rsquo;s world vision is not to practice self-hatred; it is to step outside
oneself in order to grow. On the condition, of course, that the effort
be reciprocal.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/1320419059016617985">tweet to Muslim countries, President Macron wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We will not give in, ever. [&hellip;] We will always be on the side of
human dignity and universal values.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dignity being the key word here, I do not advise you to examine the
<em>Charlie Hebdo</em> caricatures one by one with your students, but rather to
teach a class on the history of political and religious caricatures in
France. Your students will understand that in this domain, as in others,
there are good and bad instances. Not everyone is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_Daumier">Daumier</a>, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadar">Nadar</a> or a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Dor%C3%A9">Doré</a>
or, these days, a <a href="https://www.chappatte.com/">Chappatte</a>,
<a href="https://www.cartooningforpeace.org/en/dessinateurs/dilem/">Dilem</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_P%C3%A9tillon">Pétillon</a>
or
<a href="https://www.cartooningforpeace.org/en/dessinateurs/plantu/">Plantu</a>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabu">Cabu</a>&rsquo;s artistry remains
unsurpassed, as does the self-mockery of our sexual obsessions so dear
to
<a href="https://www.cartooningforpeace.org/en/dessinateurs/wolinski/">Wolinski</a>.
One is familiar with the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> front page of February 8, 2006
where Cabu has the prophet, in tears, crying out: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to be
loved by idiots!&rdquo; with the caption: &ldquo;Mohammed overwhelmed by
fundamentalists.&rdquo; The target is clearly defined. By contrast, the
caricature &ldquo;A star is born&rdquo; by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_(cartoonist)">Coco</a>, presenting
a naked Mohammed praying, offering an unobstructed view of his derrière,
targets Islam tout court. The attacks have since sacralized all caricatures
without distinction. How is one to explain to students that we have
reached a point at which it is precisely when a caricature is useless,
reduced to its most degrading function, devoid of any artistic, humoristic or
political dimension, that it is supposed to illustrate the pure state of
freedom of expression, and of our highest Republican values including
the affirmation of human dignity? No one is bound to do the impossible.</p>
<p>To the question of whether I still have the right, in the country of
free expression, to be indignant about the offensive character of
certain caricatures without being accused of hating the Republic, the
heavy atmosphere that prevails today indicates that the answer is
no. Pushed to the absolute limit, free expression no longer tolerates
free critique. The constitutional texts I have cited may well evoke
respect for beliefs, but the jihadists have attained their goal: they
have pushed us to the limit, succeeded in erecting the caricatures as
absolutes, such that France is in danger of being isolated. Your
students will benefit from reading <a href="https://www.lorientlejour.com/article/1238194/entre-la-france-et-le-monde-musulman-cest-le-dialogue-de-sourds.html">the wise editorial by Soulayma Mardam Bey</a> that appeared in the French-language Lebanese daily <em>L&rsquo;Orient Le
Jour</em>, October 27, 2020: It states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For many French people, the caricatures are today the very symbol of
their identity. For many Muslims in the Middle East, they are the
negation of theirs. This dialogue of the deaf is currently taking on inordinate proportions, each side draping itself in a purist and somewhat
anachronistic conception of what they stand for: the Republic for the
one, Islam for the other, as if the two, besides being essentially
irreconcilable, corresponded to immutable criteria, impervious to time
and space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, it is just as futile to insist on the oneness of the Republic
as the exclusive source of all value, as it is to push to the extreme
the Islamic political ideology of oneness, the famous notion of
<em>tawhid</em>. Teachers of history and geography, your mission is precisely
to remind students that we live immersed in time and space, that our
dearest values, including that of freedom of expression, have a history
that often originates elsewhere, and that we must maintain our hold on
their definitions and their conditions of exercise. I know. This task
exceeds your forces, and the official &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo; have their limits.
But if you want to make citizens, or quite simply adults, of your
students, then show them all the elements of the debate, as I have
endeavored to do here. Don&rsquo;t shut them up within prefabricated truths.
They deserve better than that.</p>
