<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This is my translation of an article written by the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mich%C3%A8le_Vergne">Michèle Vergne</a>. In it, Vergne reflects on her youth and how she became a mathematician in a sexist world. There are no stories of violence or male brutality to be had here. Vergne writes instead of the winsome face of patriarchy, a face that is, in fact, only too familiar to anyone who has lived in a state of society. This is the second part of my translation of the article.</p>
<p>Born in 1943, Vergne studied and worked in France and the United States,
becoming a professor at MIT, at the <em>École normale supérieure de jeunes filles</em>, and a director of research at CNRS (the French National Centre for Scientific Research). Her field of mathematical research is representation theory.</p>
<p>The article was originally presented in 1975 at a seminar on &ldquo;Mathematics,
Mathematicians and Society&rdquo; in the Math department of what is today <a href="https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/?lang=fr">the University of Paris-Saclay at Orsay</a>.</p>
<p>My thanks to Michèle Vergne for permission to publish this translation on my blog. The original article in French may be found on her website:<br />

<h3 id="my-warrior-initiation">My warrior initiation</h3>
<p>I was an advanced master&rsquo;s student studying under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Chevalley">Claude Chevalley</a>, who had
no idea of the psychological isolation that I experienced as a woman. It
was the period of my warrior initiation, a rite of passage that pretty
much all young researchers undergo: a period of self-doubt, of ordeals
to be undergone by oneself alone. I cite here <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/23/obituaries/colette-audry-84-novelist-and-critic.html">Colette Audry</a>,
who wrote of the difficulties that young writers encounter. What she
says explains how I felt during this period:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;but these arid inner quibblings, this doubt cast on oneself as an
individual creator, are all that the writer shall know if he is born
male; when the writer is a woman, added to these is the
outright questioning of her very belonging to a category capable of
creation. The simple interrogation of the individual ends in the latter&rsquo;s
being put to the test: nothing is given beforehand; risks must be run.
However, the questioning of the category to which one belongs blocks
everything since such questioning brings into play predestination:
everything is given beforehand; the activity is not worth the
effort.&quot;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I spoke to no one. I had been very talkative in my classes with girls
but suddenly, confronted by men upon completing high school, I found
myself tragically silenced. I was scared to talk. Even today, before I
speak in public at a seminar, I experience several moments of panic. If
a fellow came near me while I was studying in the library, it was
horrible. I immediately hid my notes so that he would not be able to see
what I had written (and, in fact, I am still like this). If I asked for
an explanation of some mathematical point, my voice trembled with fear.
If some guy spoke to me of mathematics, my ears filled with a
buzzing sound and I understood nothing and was rendered incapable of
responding with a single intelligent word. To be more precise, I
scarcely heard what he said. Instead, I heard the words, &ldquo;No woman will
ever be a genius. Go on, show me one. For instance, answer this
mathematical question&hellip; Well, in any case, there&rsquo;s nothing to be done.
It&rsquo;s biological, it&rsquo;s Nature.&rdquo; And I, I interiorized the imposed
stereotypes as per which I would surely never be capable, mathematical
&lsquo;creation&rsquo; being impossible for me as it was for all girls. And I began
to take classes in the History of Mathematics, which my adviser
considered a perfectly reasonable thing for me to do.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="dont-worry-if-you-arent-able-to-do-it">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry if you aren&rsquo;t able to do it!&rdquo;</h3>
<p>And so I was prepared for failure and received no support from any peer
group or protective clique, the benevolence of the group towards a young
woman manifesting itself in general in the following terms: &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t
worry if you aren&rsquo;t able to do it!&rdquo; Towards young men by contrast it was: &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t worry, of course you will be able to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, cut off from all living communication, from all mathematical
culture, from all real relations with my object of study, I effectively
understood Nothing. Astonishing as it may sound, as I recall, I
understood Nothing in the classes I attended. Since, in general, the
professors passed quickly over the details of proofs, and since I did
not understand the references they made to well-known, classical ideas, I
could not spot the missing markers. They said, &ldquo;By a standard reasoning, it is
proved that&hellip;&rdquo; And I was reduced to a state of utter abjectness at my
inability to divine what that standard reasoning was. I think that when
professors do not make an effort to explain from where their ideas,
their intuitions come, they are being racist and sexist, whether
deliberately or not, towards those who belong to categories that are not
immersed in a mathematical culture, and who have no other means, classes
apart, of knowing from where the ideas arise. I say this because I no
longer believe that men are predestined to
knowledge from the cradle on, while I was predestined to ignorance.</p>
<p>And all that I describe&mdash;that fear, that isolation, that difficulty to
imagine, that impossibility to speak, to have confidence in myself, to
belong to a group&mdash;I do not think those were merely my own inner burdens
that I carried around within myself. And I do not think that, had I been
less shy, prettier, less this, more that, everything would have been
much better. No, all that is false. I think I was just confronting
reality. I think that women live in a society where, overtly or
covertly, they are despised and threatened, whether mentally or
physically. Women do not interiorize irrational fears: if one is afraid,
it is with reason. And like all of society that surrounds it, the
mathematical milieu is profoundly misogynistic: if a girl speaks in
class or in a seminar, or rather if she does not speak because she is
afraid, well then, she is right to be so, because, in effect, she risks
a great deal. If the question is stupid, the entire class will
immediately arrive at a stereotypic image of her&mdash;a stereotype of a
woman, and this is always a negative stereotype which will stick close
to her skin, which will suit her perfectly. In the best of cases, they
might say, &ldquo;Yes, she is cute alright, but she would do well to spend her
time on other, less boring matters, because life has so many more
interesting things to offer, especially to women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I know that I myself, for a long period, despised all the young
women who presented bad work&mdash;all the young women who reflected back at
me a negative image of women, one that I did not want to accept.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="to-love-and-be-loved">To love and be loved</h3>
<p>I began to come out of this quite by accident. I got to know, and
subsequently married, a man who was very reassuring and who helped me
a great deal. Besides, psychologically, it was a fundamental change to be
married: &ldquo;Yes, I am not as stupid and ugly as all that because I too
have been able to find myself one &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had all manner of complexes about my physique at the time. And for a young woman, social relations and her relationship with herself are mediated in the first instance by
her physique. For a young woman to please and to be pleased, to love and be loved,
what matters above all is her physique. I still recall with pain my father&rsquo;s reaction&mdash;perhaps he was simply teasing&mdash;when I succeeded brilliantly at the <em>École Normale Supérieure</em> entrance exam: &ldquo;Well then, what would you like as a reward? Plastic surgery perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was in that milieu that I met, quite by accident,
a young woman named Monique Lévy-Nahas, who consciously called into
question the milieu&rsquo;s elitist values, which was exceedingly rare at the
time. She spoke <em>to me</em>. She did not try to valorize herself through me
for someone else. We actually spoke to one other&mdash;not while waiting for
or instead of someone else who was &lsquo;better,&rsquo; nor out of frustration at
not being listened to by some fellow who was more &lsquo;popular.&rsquo; At last, I could speak to someone about math without that buzzing sound
in my ears. She gave me a certain degree of self-confidence. She
studied theoretical physics. We began to work together. I also met a
young Algerian man who helped me greatly. I was finally able to abandon
algebraic geometry and switch to the study of Lie groups without feeling like a complete
failure. I completely surmounted that feeling of failure, and
felt capable of studying the subject with a reasonable degree of
certitude that I would be able to understand it perfectly. Before, I had had a psychological block that I had interiorized as an intellectual block.
And I think I would not have managed to overcome it had I not
decided, with their help, to study other things. I think their help was
absolutely decisive. For once, society&rsquo;s negative stereotypes helped me:
faced with a young woman and an Algerian, I felt as if I was in full
possession of all my means. I realized, always with surprise,
that at times I too was intelligent. Between these moments of surprised
joy were gaping black holes. Nevertheless, slowly, the
psychological problems I experienced as a young woman changed in nature.
I began to feel more self-confident, though I remained entirely dependent on the
appreciation of others. I had to please them because that was
what I had been taught was my <em>raison d&rsquo;être</em>.</p>
<p>Among the men though
there was a lot of aggression towards women, and no solidarity. A young
woman&rsquo;s success was always doubted: &ldquo;Well, let her prove herself. We&rsquo;ll
see afterwards if we consider her to be inferior or not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have horrible memories of the Bourbaki seminar at which I spoke in 1969. I was very nervous, very anxious to know what impression I had
made. And, of course, the first views that I heard represented to me the definitive view
of <em>everyone</em>. There were three fellows discussing the seminar among
themselves. The first&mdash;and he was the kind one&mdash;said, &ldquo;Well, what a
discovery! There are women mathematicians who are sexy!&rdquo; The second who
was rather old said, and I quote, &ldquo;Ah, it was technical. It was so
clearly a woman talking. All those petty, precise calculations, and not
one big idea.&rdquo; And the third, a student the same age as me, said, &ldquo;I
heard Serre and Thom talking. They said your talk was really bad.&rdquo; I had
a tough time getting over these views that sent me back inexorably into
my predestined category, that sordidly destroyed the little
self-confidence that I had managed to acquire despite everything. I felt
better last June when I was asked once more to speak at the Bourbaki
seminar. The invitation made me feel that that third remark had been a mere
lie invented by a frustrated young man, something that I had known rationally to be
the case all along. I confess though that I faced my second talk with
about the same anxiety as the first. And immediately after, I
encountered the very same remarks as the first two I had encountered all
those years ago. And I think, this time round, both sets of remarks were
justified after a fashion!</p>
