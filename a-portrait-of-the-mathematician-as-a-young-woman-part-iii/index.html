<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This is my translation of an article written by the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mich%C3%A8le_Vergne">Michèle Vergne</a>. In it, Vergne reflects on her youth and how she became a mathematician in a sexist world. There are no stories of violence or male brutality to be had here. Vergne writes instead of the winsome face of patriarchy&mdash;a face that is, in fact, only too familiar to anyone who has lived in a state of society. This is the third and final part of my translation of the article.</p>
<p>Born in 1943, Vergne studied and worked in France and the United States,
becoming a professor at MIT, at the <em>École normale supérieure de jeunes filles</em>, and a director of research at CNRS (the French National Centre for Scientific Research). Her field of mathematical research is representation theory.</p>
<p>The article was originally presented in 1975 at a seminar on &ldquo;Mathematics,
Mathematicians and Society&rdquo; in the Math department of what is today <a href="https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/?lang=fr">the University of Paris-Saclay at Orsay</a>.</p>
<p>My thanks to Michèle Vergne for permission to publish this translation on my blog. The original article in French may be found on her website:<br />

<h3 id="the-article-translated-part-iii">The article translated, part III</h3>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="what-am-i-doing-here">&ldquo;What am I doing here?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Once I began to make progress in mathematics, once I knew that I could
complete my thesis, bizarrely enough, I entered a period of extreme
depression. I shall not analyze at all why was I so depressed. It was
roughly a feeling of &ldquo;what I am doing here?&rdquo; I felt as if I had had
great difficulty in wanting to arrive somewhere, only to find it empty.
What I had searched for was an apology for being female. It was a search
for proof of my existence through the affective and intellectual
recognition of the only sources of recognition: men. And well, I did not
find that recognition there&mdash;at least, not as I desired it. I had work
relations that were completely alienating. But for someone to recognize
me, to love me and for me to find myself, thanks to my theorems, placed
in a certain fixed place within a one-dimensional universe &hellip; And now,
pooh! It still is rather empty &hellip; the dissociation between my
&ldquo;personality&rdquo; and my work &hellip; I continue to work in a very alienated
manner&mdash;to please not myself, but those who bring recognition: men. But
perhaps I no longer depend totally on their appreciation as I did
before. I have a measure of esteem for myself.</p>
<p>My problems as a woman cannot disappear because, in effect, they exist:
I think I continue to be isolated, being a woman. There is
discrimination&mdash;overt or insidious, voluntary or involuntary&mdash;against
all women. In informal communications, women are often excluded. Take
the case of the Bourbaki congress &hellip; Even when women &ldquo;have succeeded,&rdquo;
they are never allowed to acquire a feeling of belonging to the
profession, that feeling of professional solidarity. I do not say that
such a feeling is good or bad, but simply that it does not play a role
in the same fashion in case of women.</p>
<p>At a meeting, in a conference, mathematicians feel obliged to interrupt
their mathematical conversation if you arrive in their group, and to
engage in pleasantries. In general, it is very tedious and varyingly
heavy if you are a single, &ldquo;free&rdquo; woman, and in case of a married woman,
a sudden and considerable interest is expressed&mdash;in your children
rather than in your theorems. You are never approached for a discussion
of an interesting mathematical result, because interesting results are
only brought up with people who are themselves interesting and
susceptible of offering something in exchange, and therefore certainly
not with a woman&mdash;one may approach <em>her</em> to discuss life&rsquo;s
difficulties, or its numerous joys &hellip; I spent a year at
Berkeley&mdash;receiving nothing but compliments on my abilities as a
mathematician, coming from people who, as I well knew, knew strictly
nothing about my work. Nevertheless, they acted as if they judged it
extremely interesting, though never interesting themselves to the point
of wishing to discuss it, whether in private or public conversations.</p>
<h3 id="well-known-white-male-mathematicians">Well-known, white, male mathematicians</h3>
<p>I still feel defensive about my value as a mathematician, and once
again, I think I am right to feel thus. At the least faux pas, the
guillotine&rsquo;s blade will fall: &ldquo;They told me she was good, but really,
she isn&rsquo;t as good as all that.&rdquo; One has no credibility. One&rsquo;s words to
one&rsquo;s students are never ringed with its halo, as is the case with the
words of well-known, white, male mathematicians. If a student chooses
you as a thesis adviser, it means that that student is slightly
self-deprecating. As I think I have made clear, it isn&rsquo;t necessarily the
most uninteresting of people who are self-deprecating &hellip; Nevertheless,
thesis advising becomes more difficult. I once said to a mathematician
that his demonstration was false, and I explained why. He returned to me
two days later saying, &ldquo;Yes, my demonstration was perhaps false, because
Dixmier told me that Michel Duflo had told him it was false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is very difficult to create valuable mathematical relations with
other mathematicians outside a very tiny circle that knows you well.
First of all, the other lacks the motivation. Then, there are always the
stereotypes of paternalism, so difficult to get away from, involving as
they do the underlying notion of female inferiority. Effectively, if one
says something stupid, one needs a crazy amount of time to make a
comeback. And one can never be brilliant, that being the rule of the
game imposed on women who wish to distance themselves from paternalistic
stereotypes. I have worked these past several years with a well-known
mathematician named Hugo Rossi&mdash;a wonderful person and in our
exchanges, after a certain length of time, we had completely distanced
ourselves from the stereotypes in relation to the work we were doing. We
had a very equal relationship in practice. However, 90% of
mathematicians who see our articles will&mdash;without having read them, of
course&mdash;have the following opinion: he was the one who did all the
work. Of course, they will not say this to me, and will even invite me
to the conferences to expound on our work, because it is always
surprising to see a woman speak of mathematics, always amusing, like
watching a dog walk on its hind limbs. When I open my mouth to speak on
these occasions, I feel a certain anguish in them&mdash;and I too feel
anguished, though not for the same reasons. They are nervous, then
surprised, and finally relieved to see that I had nevertheless been
intelligent enough to understand what they had done.</p>
<p>In any case, I think that if I write an article with some guy, whether
he be famous or not, it is he who, outside a very small circle, will
receive the main credit for the article, the real experience and what
one says of it being of little consequence. Imagine that my collaborator
extraordinarily declares, &ldquo;She was the one who did it all.&rdquo; Nobody will
believe him. They will say he is too modest. If I were to say, &ldquo;He was
the one who did it all,&rdquo; it would certainly not be modesty but rather a
description of sad reality.</p>
<p>How many times has one heard it said of a taciturn, shy, male
mathematician, &ldquo;Oh, he is really very agreeable, he is good and so
modest.&rdquo; By contrast, I have never heard of modest female mathematician.
If a female mathematician says nothing, it is because she really has
nothing to say. One cannot assume for a second that she would have the
nerve to hide what she thinks.</p>
<p>Now I, most of the time, during a seminar or a mathematical
conversation, I do not say what I think, because I am afraid. And, in
fact, I have interiorized completely this sexist stereotype that such
and such certainly has ideas that are far more interesting than my own,
and that it would be far better for me to listen. And thus in a
mathematical conversation, I am not interesting, I am defensive, I never
put myself forward. I speak, perhaps, of things that I know, but I would
be too fearful to risk imagining myself as better than someone. And in
fact, my very fruitful collaboration with Hugo Rossi was through
letters: faced with a letter, I could think, but face to face with
someone, I am blocked.</p>
<p>In conclusion&mdash;what? One must learn to have a measured esteem for
oneself. Reject sterile comparisons. Reject the interiorization of what
the other&mdash;the male&mdash;says, of what he does, the idea that his destiny
is inherently more interesting. Reject one&rsquo;s own sacrifice to that
destiny, whether material or mental. Avoid contempt for oneself and for
the category to which one belongs. This is difficult when one belongs to
a category that is generally despised, that of black mathematicians,
Algerian mathematicians, women mathematicians, provincial
mathematicians, from Brittany or even from the impoverished suburbs. To
put it briefly, these individuals would be the majority, if many
researchers rejected the interiorization of elitist stereotypes.</p>
