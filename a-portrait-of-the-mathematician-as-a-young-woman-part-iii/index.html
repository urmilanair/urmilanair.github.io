<h1 itemprop="name" id="title">A portrait of the mathematician as a young woman, Part III</h1>
<p><em>June 30, 2021</em></p>



<article itemprop="articleBody" id="content">
  <br />
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This is my translation of a talk by the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mich%C3%A8le_Vergne">Michèle Vergne</a>. In it, Vergne reflects on her youth and how she became a mathematician in a sexist world. There are no stories of violence or male brutality to be had here. Vergne writes instead of the more winsome face of patriarchy&mdash;a face that is, in fact, only too familiar to anyone who has lived in a state of society. This is the third and final part of my translation of the talk.</p>
<p>Born in 1943, Vergne studied and worked in France and the United States,
becoming a professor at MIT, at the <em>École normale supérieure de jeunes filles</em>, and a director of research at CNRS (the French National Centre for Scientific Research). Her field of mathematical research is representation theory.</p>
<p>The talk was originally presented in 1975 at a seminar on &ldquo;Mathematics,
Mathematicians and Society&rdquo; in the Math department of what is today <a href="https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/?lang=fr">the University of Paris-Saclay at Orsay</a>.</p>
<p>My thanks to Michèle Vergne for permission to publish this translation on my blog. The original talk, published as an article in French, may be found on her website:<br />

<h3 id="the-talk-translated-part-iii">The talk translated, part III</h3>
<br />
<h3 id="what-am-i-doing-here">&ldquo;What am I doing here?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>It was once I began to make progress in mathematics, once I knew that I could
complete my thesis that, bizarrely enough, I entered a period of extreme
depression. I shall not analyze why was I so depressed. It was
roughly a feeling of &ldquo;what I am doing here?&rdquo; I felt as if I had had
a hard time: I had wanted to arrive somewhere, but then had found it empty.
What I had searched for was an apology for being female; it was a search
for proof of my existence, through the affective and intellectual
recognition of the only sources thereof: men. Well, I did not
find that recognition there&mdash;at least, not as I desired it. I had work
relations that were completely alienating. I worked on theorems not out of interest in the theorems themselves, but so that someone would recognize
me, love me. And, thanks to my theorems, I found myself situated
in a certain rigid place within a one-dimensional universe where mathematical value was the total order relation<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> &hellip; Nowadays, well, everything still is rather empty &hellip; the dissociation between my
&ldquo;personality&rdquo; and my work &hellip; I continue to work in a very alienated
manner&mdash;to please not myself, but rather those who bring recognition: men. But
perhaps I no longer depend totally on their appreciation as I did
before. I have a measured regard for myself.</p>
<p>The problems I face as a woman cannot disappear because, in effect, they <em>exist</em>.
I think I continue to be isolated, being a woman. There is
discrimination&mdash;overt or insidious, voluntary or involuntary&mdash;against
all women. In informal communications, women are often excluded&mdash;take
the case of the Bourbaki congress for example &hellip; Even when women &ldquo;have succeeded,&rdquo;
they are never permitted that feeling of belonging to the
profession, that feeling of professional solidarity. I do not say that
this feeling is good or bad, simply that it does not play a role
in the same fashion in case of women.</p>
<p>At meetings, in conferences, if you join their group, male mathematicians feel obliged to interrupt their mathematical conversation and
engage in pleasantries. It is very tedious in general. If you are a single woman, it is onerous to varying degrees. If you are a married woman,
they express a sudden and considerable interest&mdash;in your children
rather than in your theorems. They never approach you to discuss an interesting mathematical result, because interesting results are
only brought up with people who are themselves interesting and
susceptible of offering something in exchange, and therefore certainly
not with a woman&mdash;one may approach <em>her</em> to discuss life&rsquo;s
difficulties, or its numerous joys &hellip; I spent a year at
Berkeley, receiving nothing but compliments on my abilities as a
mathematician, coming from people who, as I was well aware, knew strictly
nothing about my work. Nevertheless, they pretended that they considered it extremely interesting&mdash;though never to the point
of wishing to discuss it, whether in private or public exchanges.</p>
<h3 id="well-known-white-male-mathematicians">Well-known, white, male mathematicians</h3>
<p>I still feel defensive about my value as a mathematician. And, once
again, I think I am right to feel thus. At the slightest faux pas, the
guillotine&rsquo;s blade descends: &ldquo;They told me she was good, but really,
she isn&rsquo;t as good as all that.&rdquo; One has no credibility. One&rsquo;s words to
one&rsquo;s students are never wreathed in its halo, as is the case with the
words of well-known, white, male mathematicians. If students choose
you as a thesis adviser, it is because they themselves are slightly
self-deprecating. Of course, as I think I have made clear, it isn&rsquo;t necessarily the
most uninteresting of people who are self-deprecating &hellip; Nevertheless,
thesis advising becomes more difficult. I once said to a mathematician
that his demonstration was false, and I explained to him why it was so. He returned to me
two days later saying, &ldquo;Yes, my demonstration was perhaps false, because
Dixmier told me that Michel Duflo had told him it was false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is very difficult to create meaningful mathematical relations with
other mathematicians beyond a very limited circle that knows you well.
On the one hand, the others lack the motivation. On the other, there are always those paternalistic
stereotypes, implying as they do that women are inferior, that are so difficult to get away from: if one
says something stupid, it takes an inordinate amount of time to reinstate oneself. And one cannot always be brilliant, yet that is the rule of the
game imposed on women if they wish to distance themselves from paternalistic
stereotypes.</p>
<p>I have worked these past several years with a well-known
mathematician named Hugo Rossi, a wonderful person. In real life, after a certain length of time, we had completely distanced
ourselves from those stereotypes in relation to the work we were doing: we
had a very equal relationship in practice. Yet, 90% of
mathematicians who see our articles, whether published or yet to be so, will&mdash;without having read the articles, of
course&mdash;have the following opinion: he was the one who did all the
work. And of course, they will not say this to me, and will even invite me
to conferences to expound on our joint work&mdash;because it is always
surprising to see a woman speak of mathematics, always amusing, rather like
watching a dog walk on its hind limbs &hellip; When I open my mouth to speak on
such occasions, I feel their anxiety, and I too feel anxious (though not for the same reasons): they are nervous, then
surprised, and finally relieved to see that I was nonetheless
intelligent enough to understand what my collaborator had done.</p>
<p>In any case, if I write an article with some man, whether famous or not, it is he who, outside a very limited circle, would
receive the main credit for the article, real life and what
one says of it being of little consequence. Imagine what would happen if my collaborator made the extraordinary declaration: &ldquo;She was the one who did it all.&rdquo; Nobody would
believe him. They would say he is too modest. On the other hand, if I were to say, &ldquo;He was
the one who did it all,&rdquo; that would certainly not be considered modesty but rather a
description&mdash;of sad reality.</p>
<p>How many times has one heard it said of a taciturn, shy, male
mathematician, &ldquo;oh, he is really very agreeable, he is really good, and so
modest &hellip;&rdquo;? By contrast, I have never heard of a modest female mathematician.
If a female mathematician says nothing, it is because she really has
nothing to say. One cannot assume for a second that she would have the
temerity to hide what she thinks.</p>
<p>Now I, most of the time, during a seminar or a mathematical
conversation, I do not say what I think, because I am afraid. And, in
fact, I have interiorized completely this sexist stereotype, that this or that man certainly has ideas that are far more interesting than my own,
and that it would be far better for me to listen to them. And thus in a
mathematical conversation, I am not interesting. I am defensive. I never
put myself forward. I speak, perhaps, of things that I know, but I would
be too fearful to risk using my imagination before someone. My very fruitful collaboration with Hugo Rossi took place, in fact, through
letters: faced with a letter, I could think. Face to face with
someone, I am blocked.</p>
<h3 id="a-measured-regard-for-oneself">A measured regard for oneself</h3>
<p>In conclusion&mdash;what? One must learn to have a measured regard for
oneself: reject sterile comparisons. Reject the interiorization of the idea that what
the other&mdash;the male&mdash;says, what he does, his destiny in a word, is inherently more interesting. Reject the idea that one must sacrifice oneself to that
destiny, whether materially or mentally. Avoid contempt for oneself and for
the category to which one belongs. This is difficult when one belongs to
a category that is generally despised&mdash;that of black mathematicians,
Algerian mathematicians, women mathematicians, provincial
mathematicians, from Brittany, from the impoverished suburbs. Yet, to
put it briefly, they would form the majority if more
researchers rejected the interiorization of elitist stereotypes.</p>
