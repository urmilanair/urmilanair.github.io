<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This is a critical review of 20<sup>th</sup>-century literary critic and art historian André Jolles&rsquo;s <em>Simple Forms</em> and his attempt at theorizing &ldquo;the totality of all literary art&rdquo;.</p>
<br />
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p><a href="https://journals.openedition.org/cei/3067?lang=en">André Jolles</a> was an early 20<sup>th</sup>-century literary critic and art historian, who attempted a systematic theorization of &ldquo;the totality of
all literary art&rdquo; (Jolles 2017: 6). His seminal text, <em>Einfache Formen</em>,
was translated from German into French in 1972 under the title <em>Formes
simples</em>. This work has played a significant role in French folklore and
oral literature studies<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. An English translation, titled <em>Simple
Forms</em>, has only been available since 2017, Jolles&rsquo;s fascinating
theory having been relegated to the sidelines for decades, at least in part
due to his adherence to Nazi ideology during the Second
World War.</p>
<p>What is Jolles&rsquo;s proposition and why is it interesting? Briefly, <em>simple
forms</em> are forms that enable the creation of all literary art although they are not,
in and by themselves, works of literature, being authorless.
Jolles develops his concept of simple forms in part as an elaboration
and re-conceptualization of folklorist Jacob Grimm&rsquo;s conception of
<em>natural poetry</em> versus <em>art poetry</em> (<em>Naturpoesie</em> and <em>Kunstpoesie</em> in
the German; ibid.: 177). The model is particularly fascinating on
account of its pure formalism: for Jolles, ultimately, <em>all literature
is a creation of language itself</em>, authors and poets being mere
&ldquo;executive&rdquo; forces of a creativity that belongs entirely to language
(ibid.: 190). This paper offers a critical analysis of Jolles&rsquo;s model.</p>
<h3 id="on-jolless-model-of-literary-forms-the-pure-actualized-and-derivative-simple-forms">On Jolles&rsquo;s model of <em>literary forms</em>: the <em>pure</em>, <em>actualized</em> and <em>derivative</em> simple forms</h3>
<p>Let us begin by considering Jolles&rsquo;s conception of language. Language,
for Jolles, possesses its own <em>Gestalt</em>, that is to say, its own
structuring and structured form: there is within language a
&ldquo;form-delimiting force&rdquo; that increases and consolidates itself
systematically, from the most basic linguistic level, amenable to
syntactical and semantic analyses, to the highest level of literary
artworks, analyzed through the principles of stylistics,
rhetoric, poetics (ibid.: 8).</p>
<p>Jolles posits, in effect, two co-occurring <em>Gestalts</em>, viz. that of
language, on the one hand, and that of the extra-linguistic world with
which humans grapple on the other. The latter, for Jolles, is
disordered confusion; it &ldquo;does not possess its own form a priori&rdquo;
(ibid.: 18). Human labor is required to organize it into a &ldquo;manifold
whose parts interpenetrate, unite, become mutually intimate, and thus
generate a structure [<em>eine Gestalt</em>], a form.&rdquo; Jolles divides this
human labor into three co-occurring categories: production (the labor of
the farmer); creation (the labor of the artisan); and interpretation
(the labor of the priest).</p>
<p>Jolles conceptualizes language and its labors in the same mold: first,
in its productive aspect, language names and thus orders the things that
are produced, created and interpreted in the world, that is to say, all
of human labor and its fruits, or, in other words, the manifold of human
experience. Second, a deeper probing reveals that language is itself, in
fact, a producing, creating and interpreting entity: &ldquo;Language creates
structure, in that language poetizes (<em>dichtet</em>) i.e., weaves into form&rdquo;
(ibid.: 14). For example, Jolles explains, there is the individual
Mussolini who once lived out his life, and then there is the literary
Mussolini, known from newspaper reports, books, anecdotes<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The
former is to the latter &ldquo;as grain is to bread: [&hellip;] he is made
poetic, created.&rdquo; Third, the interpretive labor of language involves
&ldquo;<em>knowing</em> and <em>thinking</em>&rdquo; (italics in original, ibid.: 15). This
includes, for instance, the discernment of similarities, of the
commonality of phenomena within the manifold of human experience.</p>
<p>These three labors of language contribute to the generation of its
<em>Gestalt</em>, its structuring forms, that Jolles terms <em>literary forms</em>
(ibid.: 17).</p>
<p>What are literary forms? Language&rsquo;s labor involves a stepwise ascent
with an increasing consolidation of forms, from the lowest linguistic
level (amenable to analyses via semantics and syntax), to the highest
point at which is to be found the literary artwork. Between these
extremities, along this ascending pathway in language, are the various
literary forms, forms that are themselves structured within language,
and which in turn structure the highest-level literary artworks. More
particularly, lower down along that pathway are a type of literary form
that Jolles terms <em>simple forms</em>, which are the subject matter of
Jolles&rsquo;s text, and thus of our discussion henceforth.</p>
<p>Two significant differences between the simple form and a literary
artwork must be mentioned, towards understanding the former. The first
difference has to do with our perception of their authorship: the
literary artwork appears to us clearly as the work of an individual
author. Simple forms, by contrast, have no particular author associated
with them. Importantly though, for Jolles, <em>both</em> literary artworks
<em>and</em> simple forms are ultimately <em>creations of language itself</em>, since
the author, he asserts, must be understood &ldquo;not as creative force, but
as an executive one&rdquo; (ibid.: 190). A second difference between simple
forms and literary artworks has to do with how they have been studied
(referring particularly, one imagines, to the state of affairs in the
early 20<sup>th</sup> century, the time of Jolles&rsquo;s writing, and to the predominance of
&ldquo;Culture with a capital C&rdquo;): simple forms, unlike literary artworks, are
forms not explained &ldquo;by stylistics, nor by rhetoric, nor by poetics,
perhaps indeed not even as a matter of &lsquo;writing&rsquo;; [these are] forms
which, even though they are artistic, still do not become a work of art&rdquo;
(ibid.: 8).</p>
<p>In sum, simple forms are literary forms that are, nevertheless, not
works of art in themselves, being essentially authorless. They are
creations within language, produced by the latter&rsquo;s three labors. Jolles
divides simple forms into nine types: &ldquo;legend, Sage, myth, riddle,
proverb [or saying], case, memorabile, fairy tale or joke&rdquo; (ibid.).
Notably, these nine simple forms are themselves hierarchically arranged,
from simplest to most complex simple forms, as we shall see below.</p>
<p>What constitutes a simple form? Jolles states that the simple form is
made up of what he terms <em>verbal gestures</em>. A verbal gesture is a
modular unit representing a concept within a simple form. How does it
come into being? Jolles avers that it is through the workings of
language itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is as if the variety and multiplicity of the events condensed and
formed themselves, as if events of the same kind were whirled up
together and then rearranged in the vortex so that they issued in a
concept, described a concept&rdquo;(ibid.: 34).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example of a verbal gesture within the simple form of the legend is
that of <em>a wheel with sharp blades</em>, representing the concept of mental
and physical tortures that a saint undergoes (though, as Jolles points
out, one is hard-pressed to understand how exactly it might work).</p>
<p>Next, how do simple forms come into existence? Jolles posits here a
relationship between the <em>Gestalt</em> of language and that of
extra-linguistic human reality: a simple form is produced within
language &ldquo;under the sway&rdquo; of a particular (extra-linguistic) <em>mental
disposition</em>. For instance, a mental disposition that he names
<em>imitatio</em> prevailed in the Christian Occident during the Middle Ages
(ibid.: 27 ff.). On the one hand, under its sway, within
extra-linguistic human experience, emerged the <em>saint</em> (as a person in
whose deeds and words people recognized virtue that merited imitation),
and the <em>relic</em> (as an object associated with the saint, which was holy
and powerful in its own right). On the other hand, under the sway of
this mental disposition, within language, there emerged the simple form
of the <em>legend</em>. Note that Jolles does not posit a relationship of
causality between a mental disposition and a simple form that emerges
under its sway within language. The relationship between mental
disposition and simple form is, rather, one of influence and
co-temporality, arising from the fact that it is in the nature of
language itself to describe, order and interpret the manifold of human
experience.</p>

<p>I discovered André Jolles through the work of French
anthropologist and folklorist Nicole Belmont. Belmont (1999) draws
on Jolles&rsquo;s work in formulating her own model of oral tales. She,
however, rejects the pure linguistic formalism of
Jolles&rsquo;s model. She locates the creativity that produces oral tales not in language but rather in notions of the human mind and orality derived from Freudian dream theory.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
