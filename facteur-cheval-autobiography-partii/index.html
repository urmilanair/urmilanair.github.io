<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>One day in 1879, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Cheval">Joseph Ferdinand Cheval</a>, forty-three years of age, decided <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/arts/03iht-blume.1.5546120.html">to build himself a palace</a>. He was a postman in Hauterives in southeastern France. He began to gather stones during his daily rounds and bind them together using lime, mortar and cement. He drew inspiration eclectically&mdash;from religions, history and imagery from across the world. In 1912, he was seventy-six years old and his Ideal Palace (<em>Palais Idéal</em>) was complete. People thought him insane. He, too, often espoused this view as a possibility. It was only near the end of his life that his chef-d&rsquo;œuvre was recognized as such, by figures such as André Breton, Anaïs Nin and Pablo Picasso among others. Cheval carved the following lines on the walls of the Palace&rsquo;s northern façade:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cette merveille dont l&rsquo;auteur peut être fier</em>,<br />
<em>Sera unique dans l&rsquo;Univers.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Its creator&rsquo;s pride, this marvel<br />
In the Universe will be unparalleled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the second and final part of my translation of Cheval&rsquo;s autobiography<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<br />
<h3 id="the-translation-part-ii-continued-from-part-ihttpswwwaropefastenedbetweenfrfacteur-cheval-autobiography-parti">The translation, part II (continued from <a href="https://www.aropefastenedbetween.fr/facteur-cheval-autobiography-parti/">Part I</a>)</h3>
<p>In this hecatomb (<em>hécatombe</em>), you will find all manner of things that
I have sculpted myself, as in primitive times, such as cedars, elephants,
bears, shepherds on the heath, waterfalls, all kinds of shells and
animals.</p>
<p>In the second labyrinth, still adjoining the gallery, are figures from
antiquity, seven in number; below&mdash;ostriches, flamingoes, geese and
eagles.</p>
<p>The sculptures are so strange that one feels one is in a dream.</p>
<p>Above the hecatombs (<em>hécatombes</em>), still between the east and west, and
in the middle of the Palace, at a height of 4 meters, is a large
terrace, 23 meters long and 3 meters wide, with stairs leading to it
that allow one, on one side, to climb up to the <a href="https://thewisdomdaily.com/the-french-postman-saw-a-palace-in-his-dream-10-years-later-he-built-it/">tower of barbarism</a>; on the other side, one may reach the top of a little genie
who lights up the world.</p>
<p>One reaches the terrace via four winding staircases that seem as if
carved out of rock.</p>
<p>The façade is built of stone (<em>pierre de rachat</em>)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, exceedingly hard,
which forms all manner of strange shapes, some animal-like, wrought by
the elements, many shaped as spheres.</p>
<p>The middle of the façade is made of the first stones I found. They
represent a waterfall. I took two years to make it. The little cave to
the side&mdash;three years. The large cave with three giants, is somewhat
Egyptian. The two female figures above it are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veleda">the druidess Veleda</a> and Inize.</p>
<p>Also at the side, still to the left, I had begun a Druid tomb, but the
lack of the specific type of stone prevented me from finishing it. I
took four years to complete this part.</p>
<p>Below the tower of barbarism is an oasis, where prickly pears, cacti,
palms and olive trees are represented, guarded by an otter and a
cheetah.</p>
<p>To the right, where you see four columns, is a tomb that I carved, as if
out of rock, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Cheval">I shall have myself buried</a> in the manner of the
Pharaohs.</p>
<p>Underground is a vault at a depth of 3 meters, containing two coffins in stone, their lids in the manner of the Saracens, and with double doors in iron
and stone.</p>
<p>Above the vault, which corresponds to the gallery, are figures and many
sculptures, a crèche with all manner of shells that have a dazzling
effect. This tomb is made in the style of Hindu temples; the subjects
are Christian. One sees two stone crowns. In the middle of the rock, the
cave of the Virgin Mary, the four Evangelists, a calvary, Death and
Abundance, pilgrims, angels. At the top, the mortuary urn, above it a
little genie made of little balls of very hard stone (also a type of
<em>rachat</em>). It measures 10.8 meters in height, its length is 5 meters,
its width 4 meters. I took seven years to build it.</p>
<p>The north façade, made of tufa with river stones, has a base with little
caves. One sees many things there as well: pelicans in stone or
fashioned by me, a stag, a doe, a little fawn, a crocodile. The right
has stones that resemble animals, the left, a little feudal castle.
These northern and eastern façades cost me twenty years of effort.</p>
<p>In the western façade, with its vases, you find an Arab mosque with its
crescent moon and minarets. It is the entrance to the Imaginary Palace (<em>Palais Imaginaire</em>).
You see below a Hindu temple, a Swiss chalet. Further on is the White
House, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Harrach"><em>Maison-Carrée</em> of Algiers</a> and, finally, a castle from
the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>The southern façade, that you see also surmounted by two aloes, has its
cupola and a tree trunk above some stones that resemble animals.</p>
<p>Below is my antediluvian museum, where I keep my flints and river stones (<em>pierres diluviennes</em>). These two façades, south
and west, cost me another six years of effort.</p>
<p>Hope, patience and perseverance. I withstood all&mdash;the weather,
criticism and the years.</p>
<p>The cost of the Palace is not very much, my work not counting for
anything. I constructed it during my spare time, in my leisure moments
left me by my service as a postman.</p>
<p>When I left the postal service to retire, I had constructed my home and
had encircled my Palace with high walls. I cultivate and maintain my
enclosure so that visitors, who take up some of my time, find everything
in harmony with my Palace. I accompany them to explain in detail what
they see.</p>
<p>I bought absolutely nothing but lime and cement. I used around 3500
sacks for my Palace alone, which represents a sum of 5000 francs.</p>
<p>The monument as a whole is around 1000 cubic meters of masonry.</p>
<p>When I began this work, I was forty-three years old; today, I am in my
sixty-ninth year.&quot;</p>
