<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This is my translation of a <em>Commentary on Current Affairs</em> written by <a href="https://www.fipeco.fr/apropos">François Ecalle</a> on the French blog Fipeco, devoted to analyses of public finance and the economy in France.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.aropefastenedbetween.fr/francois-ecalle-fipeco-public-debt-parti/"><strong>part I</strong></a>, Ecalle discussed how one might understand public debt. Here, he explains why public debt cannot increase ceaselessly and discusses the stabilizing of the debt-to-GDP ratio as a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for debt sustainability.</p>
<p>This is the second part of my translation of Ecalle&rsquo;s article.</p>
<p>My thanks to François Ecalle for permission to publish this translation on my blog.</p>

<h3 id="a-the-traditional-analysis-of-the-limits-of-public-debt">(A) The traditional analysis of the limits of public debt</h3>
<h4 id="1-excessive-debt-can-lead-to-a-crisis">(1) Excessive debt can lead to a crisis</h4>
<p>A State that has a deficit&mdash;France, for example, for the last 45
years&mdash;repays its debts by borrowing the amounts necessary for the
repayment<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Additionally, the State has to borrow in order to finance
the deficit of the current year.</p>
<p>Public debt cannot increase indefinitely because the State&rsquo;s creditors
would eventually begin to doubt its ability to borrow sufficiently so as
to continue repaying older debts while financing the deficit. Under such
conditions, creditors would consider that they are running a risk by
continuing to buy government debt. They would add a significant &ldquo;risk
premium&rdquo; to the stipulated interest rate if they were to continue buying
that debt. This increase in the interest rate would only aggravate the
deficit and the debt, which in turn would reinforce creditors' fears.</p>
<p>The risk premium can thus keep increasing, and the debt could then spiral out
of control. Some creditors may refuse to buy up the debt even at very
high interest rates. In such a case, the State, unable to repay its
debts or to pay the excess of its expenditure over its revenue, would have to balance its revenue and expenditure immediately, by increasing taxes
and/or cutting expenditure.</p>
<p>A State close to default generally calls on international
institutions that play the role of lender of last resort, like the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the European Stability Mechanism
(ESM) in the euro area. The latter&rsquo;s financial aid is not unlimited and comes
with strings attached, the main requirement being that measures be
implemented to balance public accounts, measures that are often painful
for the population and that translate into a loss of sovereignty. These
measures are, for the most part, based on the power to levy taxes and to
earmark the resulting funds for expenditure voted on by Parliament.</p>
<p>The creditors of a given State may agree to a restructuration of the
debt they are owed, by deferring the repayment of the principal and/or
reducing the interest rate. They may thus continue financing the State
if the latter is able to convince them that this would be less costly
than the complete loss of the credit they had extended. It is very
difficult to predict the outcome of such negotiations or the severity
of the remedial measures imposed on the defaulting State on the one
hand, and the creditors' losses on the other. Furthermore, these losses
are largely passed on by the creditors (banks, insurance companies,
etc.) to their customers. Since financial institutions within a country
often hold a great deal of the latter&rsquo;s sovereign bonds, the households
of the country may often suffer greatly.</p>
<h4 id="2-the-capacity-to-stabilize-debt-is-a-necessary-condition-for-debt-sustainability">(2) The capacity to stabilize debt is a necessary condition for debt sustainability</h4>
<p>Public debt thus cannot increase indefinitely. Nevertheless, it is
impossible to determine precisely the debt threshold beyond which a
crisis of public finance would be triggered. This is because this
threshold would depend on numerous parameters that are often not
quantifiable and are specific to country and conjuncture.</p>
<p>Japan has no difficulty financing its deficit and repaying a public debt
that is over 200% of its GDP since 2011<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. However, it holds
considerable net assets in other countries. The overall position of all
the economic agents of a country vis-à-vis the rest of the world is thus
an essential parameter.</p>
<p>The relevance and credibility of the economic policy pursued are also
essential parameters, as is the capacity to increase taxes or to reduce
public expenditure if necessary. The probable degree of solidarity from
neighboring countries, particularly within an economic and monetary
union, should also be taken into account. Finally, the State&rsquo;s relative
public debt situation with respect to that of comparable countries is
also an important parameter.</p>
<p>Economists consider that public debt is &ldquo;sustainable,&rdquo; that is, that it
does not risk leading to default or a similar situation, if the State is
able to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio within a certain horizon<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The capacity to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio to any level and within
any horizon, and thus avoid the debt&rsquo;s spiraling out of control, is the
necessary condition for debt sustainability. However, this is not a
sufficient condition: a debt that can be stabilized at 500% of GDP would
not be sustainable because the State&rsquo;s creditors would begin to worry
long before the debt reached this level and would provoke a crisis by
demanding a higher risk premium. The level to which the debt is
stabilized is thus not insignificant: the higher this level, the
greater the risk of a crisis. Yet it is impossible to determine a
maximum level.</p>

<p>While this article simplifies matters by speaking of the &ldquo;State,&rdquo;
public deficit and debt, in reality, are held by the government as a
whole (the State, local authorities, the social security
administration and non-commercial public bodies controlled by the
State or by local authorities).&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This refers to the consolidated gross debt of national accounts,

<p>The relevance of this ratio is due to the fact that GDP is an
