<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This is my translation of an <em>analytical note</em> written by <a href="https://www.fipeco.fr/apropos">François Ecalle</a> on the French blog Fipeco (<em>Finances publiques et Économie</em>, translatable as Public Finance and the Economy). Ecalle is a retired senior government official, being a former Counsellor for the Court of Auditors, a former member of the High Council of Public Finance and of the Authority for Public Statistics, as well as a lecturer in economic policy at University of Paris-I.</p>
<p>Ecalle focuses in this article on the French social security system and its deficit. He traces the system&rsquo;s historical roots in two distinct models, and attributes some of its inconsistency and impenetrability to the shifting mix of the two over time. This is the first part of my translation of the article. My thanks to François Ecalle for permission to publish this translation on my blog.</p>

<p><strong>The nature of social security in France has changed. It is often in
deficit, and the notion of restoring its balance no longer has much
meaning. Accordingly, this <em>Analytical Note</em> proposes a radical change
to the line separating financing by the state and by social security.</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="the-article">The article</h3>
<h3 id="a-the-notions-of-social-security-balance-and-debt-have-lost-much-of-their-meaning">(A) The notions of social security balance and debt have lost much of their meaning.</h3>
<p><strong>(1) The multiple definitions of social security and its balance</strong></p>
<p>Social security in France is divided into &ldquo;schemes&rdquo; (<em>régimes</em>). Each
scheme pertains to a specific population category, and is defined by
rules regarding the benefits accorded to that category and the
modalities of financing the scheme. There is thus a <em>general scheme</em> for
salaried workers in the private sector (excluding the agricultural
sector); there are schemes for self-employed workers, public officials,
the employees of certain public companies (like SNCF, the French
National Railway Company), agricultural workers, and so forth.</p>
<p>These schemes can be divided into five branches (pending the
implementation of <a href="https://www.vie-publique.fr/en-bref/276444-autonomie-financement-de-la-5e-branche-de-la-securite-sociale">the autonomy branch</a>): old-age; healthcare; family;
industrial accidents and occupational illness; and the contributions and
collections branches.</p>
<p>In case of old-age insurance, a distinction is made between <em>basic
schemes</em> and <em>supplementary schemes</em>. Both are compulsory but are
managed differently.</p>
<p>Each of the compulsory basic schemes has its own surplus or deficit. The
largest is the general scheme for non-agricultural salaried workers in
the private sector, which registered a deficit of €0.4 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>Now the social security financing laws cover the compulsory basic schemes as
well as the bodies contributing to their financing: the Old-Age
Solidarity Fund (FSV, <em>le fonds de solidarité vieillesse</em>), the Social
Debt Redemption Fund (CADES, <em>la caisse d&rsquo;amortissement de la dette sociale</em>), and the National Pension Reserve Fund (FRR, <em>le fonds de réserve pour les retraites</em>).</p>
<p>The balance of the old-age branch of the general scheme therefore makes little
sense if one does not include within it the balance of the Old-Age
Solidarity Fund (FSV), since the latter finances part of the
<em>non-contributory benefits</em> of the general scheme (that is, the
benefits not associated with the payment of social contributions). It is
therefore more relevant to consider the cumulative balance of the
general scheme and the FSV, which together registered a deficit of €1.9 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>However, social security is not limited to the general scheme, and the
balance of all the compulsory basic schemes together with the FSV
balance showed a deficit of €1.9 billion in 2019, the schemes other than
the general scheme being approximately balanced overall.</p>
<p>Furthermore, within the old-age branch, the distinction between the compulsory basic
pension scheme and the compulsory supplementary pension scheme is mainly
a historical artifact, as is the case with the distinction between
unemployment insurance and social security in the legal sense<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. For
economists and for national accountants, these social insurance schemes
are social security funds like any other, and fall within the ambit of
general government.</p>
<p>In France, social security funds (ASSO) also include the Social Debt
Redemption Fund (CADES), the National Pension Reserve Fund (FRR),
hospitals and the Job Center (<em>Pôle Emploi</em>). CADES, together with the
French Social Security Central Agency (ACOSS, <em>Agence centrale des
organismes de sécurité sociale</em>), bears the debt of the compulsory basic
social security schemes. The National Pension Reserve Fund (FRR) holds
the reserves that finance the old-age branch of the general scheme.</p>
<p>In 2019, the balance of the social security funds (ASSO) in the national
accounts showed a surplus of €14.1 billion (0.6% of GDP). This was
notably due to the surplus of the Social Debt Redemption Fund (CADES, to
the tune of €15.9 billion)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There are thus many definitions of the social security balance. And the same is true of social debt. One can distinguish in particular between two types
of debt: on the one hand is the debt of the general scheme, borne by the
French Social Security Central Agency (ACOSS, which amounted to €22 billion at the end of 2019) or by the Social Debt Redemption Fund
(CADES, which stood at €89 billion). On the other is the debt of the
social security funds (ASSO, which stood at €193 billion).</p>
<p><strong>(2) Of Bismarck and Beveridge: an evolution from insurance schemes financed by social contributions to universal schemes financed by taxes earmarked by the state</strong></p>
<p>Social security in France was originally based on the Bismarck or social
health insurance model <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>: social benefits were financed by social
contributions and depended heavily on the latter, insofar as it was
necessary to pay social contributions in order to receive social
benefits<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. In such a model, scheme managers have to balance social
benefits and contributions. In case of a deficit, either the social
contribution rate has to be increased or the social benefits reduced.
The notion of a balance of accounts of schemes thus has a clear meaning.</p>
<p>Subsequently, health insurance and family benefits were universalized,
following the logic of solidarity of the Beveridge model of health
care<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. These benefits were also adjusted for revenue in case of
family allowances (<em>allocation familiale</em>)<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. With the creation of the
Generalized Social Contribution (CSG, <em>contribution sociale
généralisée</em>), the financing of health insurance was partly adapted to
replace salaried workers' social contributions. However, the adaptation
was only partial since employers' social contributions have been
maintained. Thus, family benefits continue to be financed by
(employers') social contributions.</p>
<p>The relation between social contributions and benefits has also been
weakened by reductions in social contributions, particularly those paid
by workers earning low wages (these reductions amounting to €60 billion
in 2019 for all the social security schemes combined). There has been no
corresponding reduction in social benefits.</p>
<p>Additionally, various provisions have introduced elements of solidarity
in all schemes (in keeping with the Beveridge model): minimum
replacement income, increase in social benefits as a function of family
situation, disabilities, etc.</p>
<p>As per the report of July 2019 on <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/piketty/2019/09/10/what-is-a-fair-pension-system/">the creation of a universal pension plan</a>,
solidarity schemes represent around a quarter of the expenditure of
pension schemes.</p>
<p>Finally, a number of taxes have been earmarked for social security.
Social contributions thus represented only around half of the revenues
of the general scheme and of the Old-Age Solidarity Fund (FSV) in 2019.</p>
<p>The creation of the Old-Age Solidarity Fund (FSV) has enabled a certain
degree of clarification: this fund makes it possible to isolate certain
pension benefits that pertain to a logic of solidarity (for instance,
the validation of quarters as periods of unemployment). These pension
benefits can be financed by earmarked taxes, that is, in accordance with
the Beveridge model (mainly by the Generalized Social Contribution,
CSG). Furthermore, the financing of housing allocations has been
transferred from the family branch of social security to the state. This
clarification is, however, insufficient.</p>
<p>In the Beveridge model, social benefits must be financed by taxes and by
the state, as is the case in the UK and in Scandinavian countries. The
present French system contains an often indiscriminate mix of elements
of the Beveridge and Bismarck models. The balance of social security
accounts depends heavily on the sharing of solidarity expenditure
between social security schemes and the state (or even local
authorities) on the one hand, and the distribution of earmarked taxes on
the other. The sharing of solidarity expenditure and taxes, between
state, schemes and funds, has become simultaneously financially
decisive, incomprehensible and very unstable<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S EXPLANATORY NOTE:</p>
<p>Regarding the distinction Ecalle invokes between &ldquo;unemployment
insurance and social security in the legal sense&rdquo;: in France,
&ldquo;social security in the legal sense&rdquo; does not cover all social risks
(<em>risques sociaux</em>) that could result in unemployment. Instead, it
is the category of &ldquo;social protection&rdquo; (<em>protection sociale</em>) that
covers these social risks more broadly. So, while some risks entailing the
need for unemployment insurance would fall under the category of
&ldquo;social protection,&rdquo; others would fall under the
category of &ldquo;social security,&rdquo; the distinction being&ndash;as Ecalle
states&ndash;an artifact of the historical emergence of the two
categories in France. This explanation is based on an article by
Etienne Marie, a government official who worked in the French social
security system for decades and headed the National Family Allowance
Fund (<em>Caisse nationale des allocations familiales</em>, CNAF): Etienne
Marie, &ldquo;<em>Anciens et nouveaux risques sociaux</em>,&rdquo; <em>Vie Sociale</em>, 2,
no. 10. 2015: 173-202.

<p>AUTHOR&rsquo;S NOTE :</p>
<p>The Social Debt Redemption Fund (CADES) receives tax revenues,
particularly the social debt redemption tax (CRDS, <em>Contribution au
Remboursement de la Dette sociale</em>). These tax revenues finance both
the repayment of the capital and the payment of the interest on the
debt. While the interest payments represent an expenditure that
reduces the national balance, the same is not true in case of the
repayment of capital, which is a financial transaction (<em>opération
financière</em>) directly entered in the nation&rsquo;s balance sheet and is
thus neutralized in estimates of the public balance. Overall, the
repayment of capital neither impoverishes nor enriches CADES.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S EXPLANATORY NOTE:</p>
<p>The first version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismarck_Model">Bismarck or social health insurance model</a> was implemented in 1883 by Otto von Bismarck, with the aim of
providing healthcare to industrial workers and their families.
Under the model, people pay a fee to a fund which then pays for
their healthcare, this last being provided by either state-owned or
private institutions. This is a limited model since only those who
pay the fee have health insurance. The Bismarck model is opposed to
the Beveridge model (see below).&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S EXPLANATORY NOTE:</p>
<p>It is worth underscoring here the key difference that Ecalle invokes
in this section, between &ldquo;social contributions&rdquo; (<em>cotisation
sociale</em>) and other types of taxes: taxes (<em>impôts, taxes,
contributions</em>) are unrequited payments, that is, their payment does
not generally entail any proportional social benefit (<em>prestation</em>)
to the taxpayer. Social contributions (<em>cotisation sociale</em>), by
contrast, entail the possibility of such social benefits. See also
the &ldquo;translation note&rdquo; at the end on these terms, and the problems
posed by their current English translations.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S EXPLANATORY NOTE:</p>
<p>The basis for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beveridge_Report">Beveridge model</a> is the 1942 Beveridge Report, a
government report put together by British economist and social
reformer, Baron William
Beveridge. The
Beveridge model of health insurance considers healthcare to be a
human right. Everyone is provided healthcare under this model, and
the costs are covered by taxes. The model is thus universal and
solidarity based. The Beveridge report was influential in the
constitution of the welfare state in the UK.&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:6" role="doc-endnote">
<p>TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S EXPLANATORY NOTE:</p>
<p>Note that in France, family benefits (<em>prestations familiales</em>) is a
wide category of benefits offered to families by the state. One of
these family benefits is the <a href="https://www.cleiss.fr/docs/regimes/regime_france4.html">family allowance (<em>allocation familiale</em>)</a>, which is paid by the state to families that reside in
France and that have more than one
child.&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:7" role="doc-endnote">
<p>TRANSLATION NOTE:</p>
<p>This section presents an interesting problem from the terminological
point of view.</p>
<p>Note that, as far as terminological sources go, I have in general followed the
translations proposed on the <a href="https://www.cleiss.fr/index_en.html">website of Cleiss</a>, &ldquo;the liaison body
between the French social security institutions and their foreign
counterparts for the implementation of European Regulations and
bilateral or multilateral social security
agreements.&rdquo; I have also
used English translations proposed on various EU websites (Eur-Lex,
ECB, IATE), the OECD website, UN Term and others.</p>
<p>The terms for different forms of taxes and payments to the state are
worth clarifying at this point. In French, there are (at least) four
terms to be considered when speaking of taxes. The following is
based on an explanation that appears in <a href="https://www.nouvelobs.com/economie/20130924.OBS8274/cotisation-taxe-contribution-le-lexique-du-budget-pour-les-nuls.html">an article in the newspaper <em>NouvelObs.com</em></a>:</p>
<p>(1) <em>impôt</em> = &ldquo;tax&rdquo; (this is the typical translation, found on the
Cleiss website, in European Central Bank documents, etc.). Within
the French taxation system, <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/tax/indicator-group/english_76e12892-en">the <em>impôt</em> is a compulsory and &ldquo;unrequited payment&rdquo; to the government</a> that is mainly used to finance public expenditure.
Note that the OECD uses &ldquo;unrequited payment&rdquo; here to mean that the
<em>impôt</em> payments do not yield any proportionality of benefits to the
<em>impôt</em> payer.</p>
<p>(2) <em>taxe</em> = &ldquo;tax&rdquo;; also &ldquo;charges&rdquo; or &ldquo;duties&rdquo; (the first is used
on the Cleiss website; the other two are used in EU legal
documents). In case of ITAF (<em>impôts et taxes affectés</em>) which is a
specific type of tax, the Cleiss website uses the translation <a href="https://www.cleiss.fr/docs/regimes/regime_france/an_0.html">&ldquo;earmarked taxes&rdquo;</a>.
A <em>taxe</em> is basically an indirect <em>impôt</em>: people pay <em>impôts</em>
directly to the government (e.g. <em>impôt sur le revenu</em> is income
tax). A <em>taxe</em>, by contrast, is paid indirectly (e.g. <em>taxe sur la
valeur ajoutée</em> is value added tax and is paid by a customer who
buys a product in a shop; it is only subsequently transferred to the
government).</p>
<p>(3) <em>contribution</em> = &ldquo;contribution&rdquo; (used on the Cleiss website,
for example). This gets confusing in English because the same
English translation is used for the fourth term below, i.e.
<em>cotisation.</em> Yet there is a difference between <em>contribution</em> and
<em>cotisation</em> that is crucial to Ecalle&rsquo;s discussion here, as has
been mentioned. A <em>contribution</em> (referring to the French term here)
is essentially a type of tax (<em>impôt</em>) that is earmarked for a
specific type of government expenditure. So, for example, the CSG (<em>Contribution sociale généralisée</em>) is translated as <a href="https://www.cleiss.fr/docs/regimes/regime_france/an_0.html">General Social Contribution in English</a>.
However, this is not a <em>cotisation</em> (see below). It is an <em>impôt</em> in
that it is an &ldquo;unrequited payment&rdquo; in the OECD&rsquo;s sense of this term
(see 1 on <em>impôt</em> in this footnote).</p>
<p>(4)<em>cotisation</em> (<em>sociale</em>) = &ldquo;(social) contribution&rdquo; (used in EU
legal documents with the adjective &ldquo;social&rdquo;; used without this
qualifier on the Cleiss website). The <em>cotisation</em> is what one might
term a requited payment: in paying it, one is entitled to certain
social benefits, for example <a href="https://www.service-public.fr/professionnels-entreprises/vosdroits/F24013">pensions, health insurance, maternity care, basic old-age insurance</a>.</p>
<p>The argument that Ecalle makes here is that the <em>cotisation</em>,
strictly speaking, pertains to the logic of the Bismarck model, limited to those who pay. <em>Contributions</em> (being taxes) pertain to the logic of the Beveridge model of
solidarity and universal rights. In the English, things get
confusing because the same term &ldquo;contributions&rdquo; is used to translate
both the French terms <em>cotisation</em> and <em>contribution</em>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
