<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This is my translation of an <em>analytical note</em> written by <a href="https://www.fipeco.fr/apropos">François Ecalle</a> on the French blog Fipeco (<em>Finances publiques et Économie</em>, translatable as Public Finance and the Economy). Ecalle is a retired senior government official: he is a former Counsellor for the Court of Auditors, a former member of the High Council of Public Finance and of the Authority for Public Statistics. He is also a lecturer in economic policy at University of Paris-I.</p>
<p>Ecalle focuses in this article on the French social security system and its deficit.</p>
<p>This is the second part of my translation of the article. In the <a href="https://www.aropefastenedbetween.fr/francois-ecalle-fipeco-securite-sociale-parti/">first part of the article</a>, Ecalle traced the system&rsquo;s historical roots in two distinct models, and attributed some of its inconsistency and impenetrability to the shifting mix of the two over time. In this second part, he discusses his assertion that the notions of a social security balance and deficit have little meaning in the present.</p>
<p>My thanks to François Ecalle for permission to publish this translation on my blog.</p>

<p><strong>The nature of social security in France has changed. It is often in
deficit, and the notion of restoring its balance no longer has much
meaning. Accordingly, this <em>Analytical Note</em> proposes a radical change
to the line separating financing by the state and by social security.</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="the-article-continued-from-part-ihttpswwwaropefastenedbetweenfrfrancois-ecalle-fipeco-securite-sociale-parti">The article (continued from <a href="https://www.aropefastenedbetween.fr/francois-ecalle-fipeco-securite-sociale-parti/">Part I</a>)</h3>
<p><strong>(3) Large, unstable and obscure resource transfers and expenditures that greatly limit the meaning of the social security balance</strong></p>
<p>In the annex to the 2020 Social Security Financing Bill is a labyrinthine diagram of the social security budget, showing the channels via which taxes are allocated to social
security in accordance with the Bill<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Any dawning comprehension of this diagram would be of little avail as it changes every year, and that under conditions and for reasons
that only an initiated few within the budget and social security
departments can understand.</p>
<p>It is not even clear that these specialists of budgetary canalization (so to speak) know
what they are doing, despite the time and energy they devote to the
work. For example, the Social Security Audit Commission&rsquo;s June 2019
Report indicates that there is an error in the 2019 Social Security
Financing Bill with regard to an obscure operation to modify the
transmission channels of the Generalized Social Contribution (CSG,
<em>contribution sociale généralisée</em>) and the social security
contributions on capital income (<em>prélèvements sociaux sur les revenus
du capital</em>), dividing these between the state, the Old-Age Solidarity
Fund (FSV), and CNAM (the state health insurance office). This error
would have reduced the projected 2019 FSV balance by €0.7 billion.</p>
<p>The changes that have been made over the years to these channels are often justified,
the main justification being the need to adapt to changes in social
contribution exemptions decided by the government. A 1994 law
established the principle of full compensation by the state to social
security schemes for these exemptions. The scope of this compensation has been gradually extended, from
exemptions in the strict sense to reductions in social contributions and
tax base reductions. Yet, in 2019 at least €2 billion
worth of measures were uncompensated, for reasons that remain
obscure.</p>
<p>The modalities of compensation have varied greatly over time. The
compensation has taken the form of budgetary credits from the state, of
earmarked taxes or of transfers of social security expenditure to the
state. Compensations have been calculated down to the nearest euro,
whether <em>ex ante</em> or <em>ex post</em>, sometimes taking into account the
surplus revenue for social security resulting from job creation due to
the exemptions or the earmarking of a tax or a portion thereof for the
balance of accounts (cf. the 2018 report of the High Council for social
protection funding). Most of these changes have had an impact on the
social security balance.</p>
<p>Among the most important changes, the following may be cited as
examples, though in no way do they constitute an exhaustive list: the cost
of the <a href="https://www.gouvernement.fr/sites/default/files/locale/piece-jointe/2014/09/frenchresponsabilitypact-en.pdf">responsibility and solidarity pact</a>, implemented during the term of President François Hollande, was
mainly offset in 2015 and 2016 by having the state budget take over
certain housing assistance costs. Next, the revenue from the Generalized
Social Contribution (CSG) increased sharply in 2018, partly to
counterbalance the drop in social contributions from salaried
workers. The distribution of this revenue among beneficiaries has been profoundly
modified. The increase in the 2018 social security revenue from the CSG
has also led the government to reduce the share of Value Added Tax (VAT)
earmarked for CNAM (the state health insurance office). Furthermore, the French
Social Security Central Agency (ACOSS) was allocated a percentage of VAT
so as to compensate UNEDIC (the National
Professional Union for Employment in Industry and Trade) for the loss of
social contributions from salaried workers. A part of the revenue from
social security contributions on capital income as well as the revenue
from solidarity social contributions of 2% were also transferred to the
state in 2018.</p>
<p>In 2019, CICE (the tax credit for competitiveness and employment) was
replaced by a reduction in employers' social contributions. This led to
a review of social security financing. To counterbalance the elimination
of this tax credit, there was an increase in reductions in employers'
social contributions levied on lower salaries. These reductions
now affect the social contributions to UNEDIC and AGIRC-ARRCO (the
mandatory supplementary pension schemes for the private sector). In
2019, the losses faced by these two were covered by the French
Social Security Central Agency (ACOSS): ACOSS received a percentage of
VAT to compensate AGIRC-ARRCO, and a percentage of payroll tax to
compensate UNEDIC.</p>
<p>In 2019, the state did not compensate the social security system for the
cost of the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/france-adopts-emergency-economic-measures-in-response-to-yellow-vest-protests/">emergency measures voted in December 2018</a>. The measures were adopted in response to the Yellow Vest or <em>Gilet Jaune</em> protests
against proposed increases in taxes on hydrocarbons, aimed at curbing
emissions. The measures included special tax-free bonuses of up to €1000
for lower wage
earners. The costs of the emergency measures amounted to €2.8 billion.</p>
<p>The prospects of increases in social security fund (ASSO) surpluses led the government, in the January 2018 public finance programming
bill, to plan for a ceiling on this surplus at 0.8 percentage points of
GDP from 2019 onwards. They did not, however, specify the form that such
a ceiling would take. This ceiling no longer appears in the April 2019
<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/stability-and-growth-pact/stability-and-convergence-programmes_en">Stability Programme</a>
for France, but serves to illustrate the very conventional nature
of the social security balance of accounts.</p>
<p>Another recent illustration is the June
2020 debate about whether the social security debt due to
the health crisis should be allocated to the state or to the Social Debt Redemption Fund
(CADES, <em>la caisse d&rsquo;amortissement de la dette sociale</em>). There is sure to be a similarly animated debate about the resources allocated to the future autonomy branch of social security, and its separation from the health branch, the state and the departments.</p>
<p>In all, the social security accounting balance and, consequently, the
social security debt, have lost a large part of their meaning. Only the
balance and debt of general government as a whole has any meaning.</p>
