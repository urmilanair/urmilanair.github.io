<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This is my translation of an <em>analytical note</em> written by <a href="https://www.fipeco.fr/apropos">François Ecalle</a> on the French blog Fipeco (<em>Finances publiques et Économie</em>, translatable as Public Finance and the Economy). Ecalle is a retired senior government official: he is a former Counsellor for the Court of Auditors, a former member of the High Council of Public Finance and of the Authority for Public Statistics. He is also a lecturer in economic policy at University of Paris-I.</p>
<p>Ecalle focuses in this article on the French social security system and its deficit.</p>
<p>This is the third and final part of my translation of tEcalle&rsquo;s analytical note. In the <a href="https://www.aropefastenedbetween.fr/francois-ecalle-fipeco-securite-sociale-parti/">first part</a>, Ecalle traced the system&rsquo;s historical roots in two distinct models, and attributed some of its inconsistency and impenetrability to the shifting mix of the two over time. In the <a href="https://www.aropefastenedbetween.fr/francois-ecalle-fipeco-securite-sociale-partii/">second part</a>, he discussed his assertion that the notions of a social security balance and deficit have little meaning in the present. In this final part, Ecalle discusses his propositions for possible modifications to the French social security system&rsquo;s financing, with a view to clarifying the categories of its balance and deficit.</p>

<p><strong>The nature of social security in France has changed. It is often in
deficit, and the notion of restoring its balance no longer has much
meaning. Accordingly, this <em>Analytical Note</em> proposes a radical change
to the line separating financing by the state and by social security.</strong></p>

<p>The reforms proposed below would have to be analyzed in depth, and could
only be implemented gradually.</p>
<p><strong>(1) A necessary distinction between the Bismarck model of limited social insurance, and the solidarity-based Beveridge model</strong></p>
<p>Social protection covers two types of social benefits. The first
pertains to the logic of the Bismarck model of limited social insurance.
These benefits replace income that is no longer received (pensions for
example) or reimburse charges (health insurance for example) only for those who pay. The second type of benefits pertains to the Beveridge model with
its logic of solidarity. These benefits give access to services based on need; they provide for a minimum income, either to all
citizens or only to the poorest, independent of the social contributions
and taxes that they have paid. Today in France, retirement pensions are
chiefly of the first type; health insurance expenditures (excluding
daily allowances), family and housing benefits are of the second
type<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As per the Bismarck model&rsquo;s &ldquo;contributory&rdquo; logic, social benefits must
be financed via levies on income from the activities that the
benefits replace. This is the principal characteristic of social
benefits. As per the Beveridge model&rsquo;s &ldquo;non-contributory&rdquo; logic, social
benefits must be financed by taxes on all income (like the CSG, the
Generalized Social Contribution) or must be paid by all households (like VAT). This is the characteristic of &ldquo;all types of taxes&rdquo;&mdash;as
provided for in the Constitution<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This distinction between the two models has important economic
consequences, as a <a href="https://www.cae-eco.fr/staticfiles/pdf/cae-note028-en.pdf">2016 Council of Economic Analysis Note has highlighted</a>.
If members of the working population consider that social contributions
deducted from income entail future replacement income in case of job
loss, then they are more willing to accept their loss of purchasing
power due to increases in such contributions. Social
contributions&mdash;whether from salaried workers or employers&mdash;are
here viewed as a sort of &lsquo;deferred wage&rsquo; and thus produce relatively
small increases in labor costs for employers<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>By contrast, members of the working population are less willing to
accept income losses aimed at financing universal social benefits or
income-based benefits which are not, therefore, meant for them
specifically. Obligatory levies in this case tend to exert a greater
upward pressure on labor costs.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.ipp.eu/publication/incidence-of-social-security-contributions-evidence-from-france/">econometric study published in June 2017 by the <em>Institut des Politiques Publiques</em></a>
(the Institute of Public Policy) corroborates the relevance of this
distinction in relation to changes in social contributions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a country where the issue of inequality is highly polemicized, it is important to highlight the actual scope of
solidarity in social protection.</p>
<p><strong>(2) A transfer to the state of the expenditures and debts of the health and family branches of social security</strong></p>
<p>Social benefits pertain to a logic of solidarity irrespective of the
scheme to which they belong. These benefits should be financed by taxes,
and therefore by the state within the framework of finance laws. In
particular, the following should be financed thus: family benefits
(considered together with housing benefits which have been transferred
from the family branch of social security to the state <a href="https://www.aropefastenedbetween.fr/francois-ecalle-fipeco-securite-sociale-parti/">as mentioned previously</a>),
health insurance expenditures, and also expenditures in favor of
dependents who are, moreover, difficult to distinguish when they undergo
treatment in hospitals. These expenditures would be paid by the concerned social security funds just as they are at present; only
their financing circuits would change.</p>
<p>The social contributions&mdash;currently levied only on
employers&mdash;-allocated to the family and health insurance branches of
all the social security schemes would be replaced gradually by taxes,
particularly the VAT, the CSG (the Generalized Social Contribution), and
income tax, taking into account the amounts involved. During the
transition period, the social security funds would be financed
simultaneously by the current social contributions (which would reduce
gradually), by the French Social Security Central Agency  (ACOSS,
<em>Agence centrale des organismes de sécurité sociale</em>), and by state
transfers deriving from the gradual rate increases in VAT, CSG and income tax. Once stability has been achieved, the CSG and other taxes would be
levied by the state. The state would then grant funds for health
insurance and family allowances. A balance of accounts would here refer to
the difference between these expenditures and the amounts voted by Parliament.
This would then allow for an adjustment the following year, in the form
of an increase or decrease of these expenditures, equal to the
difference between planned and actual expenditures. This would be
coherent with the budget rules focused on multiannual expenditure
objectives.</p>
<p>The social security funds would thus be in debt only in the short term,
accounting deficits being absorbed by lowering the following year&rsquo;s
expenditure, perhaps even by increasing state allocations. Inherited debts
from the past would be taken over entirely by the state, including the
debts borne by the Social Debt Redemption Fund (CADES, <em>la caisse
d&rsquo;amortissement de la dette sociale</em>) or by ACOSS, as well as the debts
resulting from the present pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>(3) To create a true Old-Age Solidarity Fund</strong></p>
<p>The pensions of most retirees involve a solidarity component: the increases
depending on the number of children, the minimum pension, the part of the
pension corresponding to quarters that are validated even though there
were no contributions paid (due to unemployment for instance), the
pension paid before the minimum retirement age in case of strenuous
occupations, and so forth. At present, these solidarity benefits are not
always clearly identified and only a small part of them is financed by
the Old-Age Solidarity Fund (FSV, <em>le fonds de solidarité vieillesse</em>). Instead of this, a <em>true</em> Old-Age Solidarity Fund should be created: it would be
financed by the state and would reimburse the total cost of all
solidarity-based pension funding.</p>
<p>Towards this, the social security funds' accounts would need to have two
sections: one section for funding based on the Bismarck model, where social
contributions and their corresponding benefits would be recorded, and a second section for funding based on the Beveridge model, the revenues for
which would come from allocations from solidarity-based funds, and the
expenditures of which would include the solidarity-based elements of
pensions. Pensions would still be paid via a single transfer from the concerned
fund to the beneficiaries, but the monies from the two
sections would be distinguished in the information given to retirees.</p>
<p>The creation of such a solidarity-based fund was essential to the
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50670613">universal system of retirement proposed by President Macron&rsquo;s government in 2019</a>.
In that system by points, the solidarity-based fund would not have yielded
payments to pension funds but would instead have bought points from them. Within the individual accounts of beneficiaries of
solidarity-based benefits, these
points would then have been added to the points resulting from social
contributions. No matter what the outcome of the retirement
reform plan, this solidarity-based fund should be created.</p>
<p><strong>(4) Maintaining an old-age insurance scheme financed by social contributions and reserves in the event of an economic crisis</strong></p>
<p>The social security financing laws should be transformed into financing
laws for compulsory social insurance, extending their scope to
supplementary pension schemes, and withdrawing from this scope the family
and health branches as well as the future autonomy branch. These last
would receive resource funding from the state while the retirement
branch would only be financed by social contributions and by solidarity-based
fund allocations.</p>
<p>The balance of pension schemes&mdash;or of a future universal
system of retirement&mdash;would enable the verification of the basic principle of a
pay-as-you-go scheme (<em>régime par répartition</em>), that total contributory
benefits equal total social contributions. If this principle was not
respected, an adjustment of either benefits or contributions would be
necessary. This reckoning of the pension schemes' balance would have to
take into account the impact of fluctuations in economic activity on
social contributions, by considering either the structural balance<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
or the average of balances recorded over several years. Under these
conditions, the pension schemes would not be significantly in debt in
the long-term. If their balances were extremely unbalanced, following a
grave and unforeseen crisis for example, the pension schemes would be
able to mobilize reserves constituted during periods of economic
growth.</p>
<p>The historical debt of the old-age branch of the general scheme of
social security, borne principally by the Social Debt Redemption Fund
(CADES, <em>la caisse d&rsquo;amortissement de la dette sociale</em>), would have to
be transferred to the state, and the deficit due to the current pandemic
would have to be financed by selling assets of the pension reserve fund
(FRR, <em>le fonds de réserve pour les retraites</em>) and of the supplementary
schemes.</p>
<p>As per the Pension Orientation Council (<em>conseil d&rsquo;orientation des
retraites</em>), if the GDP decreases by 11% as predicted by the government,
the deficit of the pension schemes for private sector salaried workers
would be around €27 billion in 2020<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. The assets of the pension
reserve fund (FRR) were worth €34 billion at the end of 2019, and
those of AGIRC-ARRCO (the mandatory supplementary pension schemes for
the private sector) were valued at €65 billion. Their sale in the
present context would probably not fetch these sums but would still be able
to finance a large part of the 2020 and 2021 deficits. Beyond that, it
will probably be necessary to change the parameters of social
contributions and benefits.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="c-conclusion">(C) Conclusion</h3>
<p>There are several definitions of &ldquo;social security&rdquo; and they correspond
to different account balances. While the compulsory basic schemes and
the Old-Age Solidarity Fund (FSV, <em>le fonds de solidarité vieillesse</em>)
showed a deficit of €1.9 billion in 2019, the social security
administrations (ASSO) of the national accounts showed a surplus of
€14.1 billion.</p>
<p>The social security system was founded after the Second World War based
on the Bismarck model of limited social insurance, wherein social
benefits depend on social contributions with the two balancing each
other. The system gradually evolved towards the Beveridge model, wherein
a logic of solidarity operates: social benefits are not dependent on
social contributions but rather on the needs of households, and benefits
may be adjusted according to income. In this model, social benefits must
be financed by taxes and the state.</p>
<p>No matter how it is defined, the social security balance depends
crucially on the sharing of solidarity-based expenditures and
earmarked taxes, between the state, the social security schemes and social funds. Now,
the mechanisms pertaining to the Bismarck social insurance and the Beveridge
solidarity models are often mixed indiscriminately, so that this
sharing has become incomprehensible and very unstable. The social
security account balance and, consequently, its debt, have thus lost a
large part of their meaning. Only the balance and the debt of general
government as a whole have any real meaning.</p>
<p>The social benefits of health insurance and the expenditures on families
and dependent persons pertain at present to the logic of solidarity. The funds
concerned should be financed by state allocations fixed in dependence on
specific expenditure objectives. Their balance would then refer to any
gap between these objectives and the observed expenditure, corresponding
to which an adjustment could be made the following year.</p>
<p>A true Old-Age Solidarity Fund should be created, as in the project for
a universal system of retirement, which would be financed by the state,
and would reimburse the pension funds for the cost of the solidarity-based mechanisms as a whole. A deficit of pension funds would then
signify clearly that the basic principle of a pay-as-you-go scheme is
not being respected, and that total contributory benefits do not equal
total social contributions. In case of a grave crisis, the pension
schemes would mobilize reserves that have been constituted beforehand.</p>
<p>The historical debt of the general scheme&rsquo;s old-age branch and of the
Old-Age Solidarity Fund (FSV), borne mainly by CADES, should be
transferred to the state, and the 2020 and 2021
deficits of the pension schemes should be financed by the sale of assets
of the pension reserve fund (FRR) and the supplementary schemes.</p>

<p>The principles of the functioning of unemployment insurance should
be clarified. While the scheme clearly followed the Bismarck model
at its inception, its nature has changed with recent reforms&mdash;with its extension to self-employed workers, with the distancing of
social contributions and allocations given the reduction of these two
in case of the highest paid salaried workers, with the substitution of taxes for
social contributions.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
