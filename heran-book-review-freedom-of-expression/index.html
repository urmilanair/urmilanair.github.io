<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This is a book review of sociologist François Héran&rsquo;s 2021 <em>Lettre aux professeurs sur la liberté d&rsquo;expression</em>. Analyzing the current French conjuncture, marked indelibly by gruesome violence and frenzied polemics surrounding the caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, Héran exhorts teachers&mdash;and citizens more generally&mdash;to work to preserve democracy. Héran proposes the judicious exercise of freedom of expression in public discourse: public critique, he stresses, must be founded in reason, valid information and respect for all beliefs. Héran&rsquo;s work yields the following insight: his addressees constitute what one might term a <em>Cartesian counterpublic</em>, with all the fraught implications the term carries.</p>

<h3 id="the-review">The review</h3>
<p>The time is September-October 2020, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo_shooting">trial of the 2015 <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> killers</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Samuel_Paty">assassination of schoolteacher Samuel Paty</a>. The
space is that of France, in the throes of violence and polemics
surrounding the caricatures of the Prophet &ldquo;<em>Mahomet</em>.&rdquo; The deeper
questions involved are age-old, concerning the nature of social
relations and how to ensure stable social reproduction, questions that
have been contemplated the world over by generations of
anthropologists, philosophers, sociologists and social theorists. Within
the current French conjuncture, the book&rsquo;s central concern is: given a
society, given the coexistence in that society of people with diverse
beliefs, given the historically rooted realities of inequality and
systemic discrimination, how may social relations be constituted towards
ensuring the perdurance of democracy?</p>
<p>Social relations today are shaped by social and mainstream media, the
two feeding each other with messages that circulate among myriad
publics. The exercise of freedom of expression (<em>liberté d&rsquo;expression</em>)
within these messages is therefore critical to social relations. Héran&rsquo;s
proposition is that, to preserve democracy in such a society, freedom of
expression must be judiciously exercised in public discourse: public
critique must be founded in reason, valid information and respect for
all beliefs.</p>
<p>The book opens with Héran&rsquo;s letter to history and geography teachers,
published in the wake of Paty&rsquo;s assassination. While his explicit
addressees are schoolteachers in France, his intended addressees are a
far vaster group including, essentially, citizens everywhere. For the
features of the French conjuncture characterize societies across the
globe today. The letter presents the main threads of Héran&rsquo;s argument.
His diagnosis is that the jihadists have attained their goal with the
current sacralizing of desacralization in France: the caricatures of
Islam&rsquo;s prophet are treated as absolutes; debate about them is all but
prohibited. Freedom of expression has thus been abandoned&mdash;and this,
paradoxically, precisely in its ostensible pursuit. Héran ends the
letter with an exhortation to teachers to inculcate in their students
the capacity to read widely and to reason from texts that are
well-founded, with a view to preserving democracy and freedom of
expression.</p>
<p>The body of the book then details Héran&rsquo;s analyses and arguments.</p>
<p>The first two chapters are ethnographic, setting the scene with a thick
description of key events, institutions, actors and their views,
circulating in verbal and graphical form. The context is one of
collective horror and grief at Paty&rsquo;s brutal murder, due to his use of
the caricatures in his classroom. Héran analyzes these caricatures,
sketching out the shifts in their meanings: at the moment of their first
publication, caricatures typically respond to specific events. Over
time, and with republication, these historical alibis tend to be lost.
All that remains is the image and its caption, which take on new
meanings as a function of their new contexts. Thus a caricature that
originally lampooned a specific event, when republished within a new
context, can end up targeting a community of believers and their
beliefs. Caricaturists respond to critiques by asserting their right to
freedom of expression. Discursive violence turns physical, and things
rapidly spin out of control.</p>
<p>Héran&rsquo;s analytical armature is simple, consisting in the triad of
<em>words</em>, <em>things</em> and <em>effects</em> (<em>le mot, la chose, l&rsquo;effet</em>; pp.
108-109). Over the course of the following three chapters, he deploys
ethnographic, statistical, historical and comparative legal methods to
study the relations and interstices between <em>words</em>, <em>things</em> and
<em>effects</em>. His aim is to unveil the incongruences between prevailing
views and social realities.</p>
<p>Consider for instance his analysis of the notion of respect for &ldquo;all
beliefs&rdquo; (<em>toutes les croyances</em>). These <em>words</em> are enshrined in the
present French constitution, begging the question: who exactly must
respect all beliefs&mdash;the French state, its agents, individual citizens?
For different interpretations would entail different <em>effects</em> in the
world. Among other <em>things</em>, Héran considers the following three: state
grants, a private institution, and educational literature drawing on
caricatures offensive to Muslims. The incongruence of <em>words</em>, <em>things</em>
and <em>effects</em> that Héran&rsquo;s research reveals in this regard raises the
question: when state grants are awarded to a private institution
producing such literature for use in schools, is the French state going
against the constitution by being involved, however indirectly, in the
disrespect of a particular religious belief?</p>
<p>Héran similarly focuses on systemic discrimination and Islamophobia:
rooted in France&rsquo;s fraught colonial past, regularly denied in public
discourse, these two haunt social reality, as revealed by statistical,
intersectional analyses. Symptomatic of this haunting was the invective
hurled by the French education minister in the wake of Samuel Paty&rsquo;s
assassination. To the bemusement of many, Jean-Michel Blanquer&rsquo;s
reaction on the heels of the brutal event was to unleash vituperation
against several strands of academic research&mdash;particularly postcolonial
and intersectional studies. He claimed that these modes of analysis were
imported from the United States, and that they furnished jihadists with
an intellectual vocabulary. The analyses vilified focus essentially on
the Other, whether considered along gender, race, historico-political or
class lines. Examining the events, the polemic and these strands of
research, Héran diagnoses a generalized lack of respect for the Other,
particularly the Muslim Other, in France today: Muslim believers must
respect all beliefs though the same is not demanded of non-believers.
The latter&rsquo;s disrespect of Muslim beliefs is regularly understood as the
exercise of freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Invoking Paul Ricoeur on the inevitability of pluralism in societies
today, Héran proposes that this asymmetry be replaced by an ethic of
mutual respect: he advocates the exercise of freedom of expression
within reasoned, informed public debate that is rooted in respect for
all beliefs. This, he argues, would nurture social relations and help
preserve democracy.</p>
<br />
<h3 id="a-cartesian-counterpublic">A Cartesian Counterpublic</h3>
<p>At first glance, Héran&rsquo;s proposition seems to smack of utopian longing
for a rational public sphere. A closer, contextualized reading reveals
the layers of complexity.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the key characteristic of Héran&rsquo;s addressees&mdash;the
public that pays attention to his words to any degree&mdash;is that they
favor well-founded reason and respect for others' beliefs. Those who do
not favor these modes of thinking would fall outside Héran&rsquo;s public. One
might therefore categorize Héran&rsquo;s addressees as being, after a fashion,
Cartesian: they <em>think</em> rationally and critically (valuing respect for
all beliefs), therefore they <em>are</em> his public.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Héran&rsquo;s call for well-founded, respectful reasoning in public
discourse indicates the relative paucity of such rationality therein
today. This is noteworthy given that, as recently as 2002, critical
theorist Michael Warner could write that <em>dominant</em> public discourse
was ideologized as a form of &ldquo;rational-critical discussion&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In other
words, as recently as 2002, rational critique was highly valorized in
public discourse, to the point that it was generally claimed to be its
characteristic feature (whether rightly or not).</p>
<p>Héran&rsquo;s proposition shows us that that moment is past: ration-critical
dialogue is no longer the highly valorized form it once was. Dominant public
discourse no longer cares to claim it for its own&mdash;not in France, not
in the US, not in any number of countries the world over. Far from it.</p>
<p>Héran&rsquo;s proposition shows us that calls for ration-critical dialogue
today address not a public, but rather a <em>counterpublic</em>, in Warner&rsquo;s
sense of the term<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I invoke here Warner&rsquo;s notion of counterpublics that stand in opposition to dominant publics: counterpublics are a specific type of public. Warner delineates their specificity thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Counterpublics &hellip; like dominant publics &hellip; are ideological in that they provide a sense of active belonging that masks or compensates for the real powerlessness of human agents in capitalist society&hellip;. A counterpublic maintains at some level, conscious or not, an awareness of its subordinate status. The cultural horizon against which it marks itself off is not just a general or wider public, but a dominant one. And the conflict extends not just to ideas or policy questions, but to the speech genres and modes of address that constitute the public and to the hierarchy among media. The discourse that constitutes it is not merely a different or alternative idiom, but one that in other contexts would be regarded with hostility or with a sense of indecorousness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The counterpublic that Héran addresses, favoring rational-critical dialogue as it does, is restricted to those who
value such thinking, and who believe that mutual respect between self
and other is possible. Such a counterpublic today stands in opposition to other, more dominant publics that view such thinking with hostility&mdash;populist publics for instance.</p>
<p>In sum, yes, Héran&rsquo;s proposition does smack of a utopian longing for
rational-critical dialogue that would pervade public discourse.
Crucially though, this longing today characterizes <em>not</em> the dominant public as was apparently the case until fairly recently. Instead, this longing today characterizes a counterpublic. One
might term it a <em>Cartesian counterpublic</em>. To recapitulate its key
features: the Cartesian counterpublic values critical thinking rooted in
well-founded texts and information, and in mutual respect between self
and other&mdash;unlike dominant publics today. This is the counterpublic
that Héran&rsquo;s book addresses, whose perdurance he seeks via his
pedagogical prescription to French teachers, that they teach their
students critical thinking.</p>
<br />
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Héran&rsquo;s text is powerful because it operates on several levels.</p>
<p>At a surface level, it reads as a manifesto: its fluid prose and
crystal-clear argumentation make it accessible to the concerned citizen
who, moved by it, may put into practice Héran&rsquo;s proposition.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, the text is performative, performing its proposition of
reasoned, informed and respectful public critique in the finest tradition of scholarly rigor, engaging in
debates within sociology, anthropology, history, and comparative legal
studies. Focused on French republicanism, <em>laïcité</em>, and social inequity
and discrimination rooted in France&rsquo;s colonial past, Héran&rsquo;s book
affords a critical, comparative light on democracy, secularism and
populism in the present moment.</p>
<p>Finally, the book reveals a key shift in public
discourse: from an erstwhile valorizing of rational-critical dialogue to
the present, wherein well-founded reason rooted in the critique of
disrespect for others' beliefs can only appeal to a counterpublic.
This is the Cartesian counterpublic that Héran addresses. It sets itself
up in opposition to the dominant publics of the day, the latter
including populists and those who pander to them for political ends.</p>
<p>As the present conjuncture unfolds, in France and elsewhere, Héran&rsquo;s work is not merely timely; it is urgent.</p>
