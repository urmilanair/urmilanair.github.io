      <description>This is my translation of a talk by the mathematician Michèle Vergne. In it, Vergne reflects on her youth and how she became a mathematician in a sexist world. There are no stories of violence or male brutality to be had here. Vergne writes instead of the more winsome face of patriarchy&amp;mdash;a face that is, in fact, only too familiar to anyone who has lived in a state of society. This is the third and final part of my translation of the talk.</description>

      <title>The Cartesian Counterpublic:&lt;br /&gt;a review of François Héran&#39;s book&lt;br /&gt;_Lettre aux professeurs sur la liberté d&#39;expression_</title>

      <guid>https://www.aropefastenedbetween.fr/heran-book-review-freedom-of-expression/</guid>
      <description>This is a book review of sociologist François Héran&amp;rsquo;s 2021 &lt;em&gt;Lettre aux professeurs sur la liberté d&amp;rsquo;expression&lt;/em&gt;. Analyzing the current French conjuncture, marked indelibly by gruesome violence and frenzied polemics surrounding the caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, Héran exhorts teachers&amp;mdash;and citizens more generally&amp;mdash;to work to preserve democracy. Héran proposes the judicious exercise of freedom of expression in public discourse: public critique, he stresses, must be founded in reason, valid information and respect for all beliefs. Héran&amp;rsquo;s work yields the following insight: his addressees constitute what one might term a &lt;em&gt;Cartesian counterpublic&lt;/em&gt;, with all the fraught implications the term carries.</description>

This is the final part of my translation of Ecalle&amp;rsquo;s article. Ecalle discusses here his propositions for possible modifications to the French social security system&amp;rsquo;s financing, with a view to clarifying the categories of its balance and deficit.</description>

      <description>This is my translation of an &lt;em&gt;analytical note&lt;/em&gt; written by François Ecalle on the French blog Fipeco, devoted to analyses of public finance and the economy in France. Ecalle focuses in this article on the French social security system and its deficit. He traces the system&amp;rsquo;s historical roots in two distinct models, and attributes some of its inconsistency and impenetrability to the shifting mix of the two over time. This is the first part of my translation of the article.</description>

      <description>This is my translation of a talk by the mathematician Michèle Vergne. In it, Vergne reflects on her youth and how she became a mathematician in a sexist world. There are no stories of violence or male brutality to be had here; Vergne writes of the winsome face of patriarchy. This is a face only too familiar to those who have marked their growth years in books, from Austen to Zola, from Laura Ingalls Wilder to Anna Karenina. Indeed, this face is familiar to anyone who has lived in a state of society. This is the first part of my translation of the talk.</description>

      <title>Subtitled Video: an interview with Claire Voisin, mathematician</title>

      <guid>https://www.aropefastenedbetween.fr/subtitled-video-an-interview-with-claire-voisin-mathematician/</guid>
      <description>I subtitled this video of an interview with renowned French mathematician Claire Voisin. In it she reflects on how she came to study mathematics, on its boundless nature, on the inadequacies of math teaching in schools, and on the experience of doing mathematics. What fascinates me is the way mathematicians often seem to anthropomorphize their own mathematical thought processes. Ramanujan famously attributed his mathematical insights to a goddess. Voisin here speaks of an &amp;ldquo;ideal person&amp;rdquo; inside herself who seems to do mathematics even as she performs banal chores.</description>

      <description>This video that I have subtitled in English is excerpted from a talk in French by François Héran, sociologist and demographer. It focuses on the idea of freedom of expression (Fr. &lt;em&gt;liberté d&amp;rsquo;expression&lt;/em&gt;). The talk was addressed to history and geography teachers in France in the wake of the murder of Samuel Paty. Himself a history and geography teacher, Paty had used caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in his class and was consequently killed by a young jihadist of Chechen origin. Héran gave this talk on October 30, 2020 during his course on migration at the &lt;em&gt;Collège de France&lt;/em&gt;.</description>
