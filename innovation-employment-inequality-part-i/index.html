<p><strong>Is innovation going to make jobs disappear? While its effects vary
considerably depending on the person and her skills, innovation generally tends
to favor the highly skilled to the detriment of those less so.</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="the-article">The article</h3>
<p>The question of the effects of technology on work is an old one<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The
invention of the steam engine and the internal combustion engine forced
industrial societies early on to confront the emergence of technological
unemployment. The concern fueled many a social struggle, the most famous
one being that of the Luddites at the start of the industrial era in
England. Yet, the prophecy that jobs would disappear, with humans being replaced by machines on a large scale, has not been fulfilled&mdash;to this day.
Now, however, digital technologies, driven by advances in big data and
artificial intelligence, are reviving fears among some researchers, of a possible massive
disappearance of jobs (Frey and Osborne 2017; McAfee and
Brynjolfsson 2017).</p>
<p>While this troubling question certainly merits examination, it should
not overshadow other concerns. Indeed, several recent studies have
demonstrated that what our societies must confront, well in advance of any large-scale disappearance of jobs, are profound changes to the structure
of employment<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The transformations in skill requirements induced by
recent innovations raise questions about the evolution of job quality
and the rise of new forms of inequality in the labor market<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Drawing on a set of recent studies, this article shows that
technological and organizational innovation has favorable effects on
jobs and job quality in case of high-skilled occupations (indexed, for example, by an increase in the number of permanent positions). Low-skilled occupations and
precarious jobs, however, often disappear (with various short- and fixed-term positions being eliminated). Low-skilled and
precarious positions also often suffer a decline in job conditions when
innovations are implemented, for example an increase in physical risk. A
study of the mechanisms at work offers insights into measures that could
help counteract these destabilizing effects. In the absence of a
consideration of such measures, a steady pace of innovation could, in
the medium term, contribute to a further increase in social inequalities
which are already on the rise.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-technological-change-and-innovation">What we talk about when we talk about technological change and innovation</h3>
<p>While there is much debate about the effects of technological change on
employment, the question of how to measure such change is far from
resolved.</p>
<p>In macroeconomic models aimed at explaining growth, &ldquo;technical progress&rdquo;
was initially considered a residual, that is, a factor whose origin was
not explained but which was observed to contribute to growth in addition
to the usual factors of production (namely, labor and capital)<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Endogenous
models of growth have subsequently proposed explanations of the origins
of technical progress<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> by foregrounding the role of human capital
(education, training, health), public capital (infrastructure that
generates positive externalities<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> for private producers, etc.) and,
of course, technological capital (R&amp;D, patents, etc.).</p>
<p>Economic analyses of the effects of technological
change on employment often use R&amp;D expenditure or patent registrations as
technological innovation indicators for countries and firms.
Public policy at French as well as European levels also
relies on these indicators to evaluate the progress of countries in
terms of innovation. One of the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy is
thus to have 3% of GDP devoted to R&amp;D expenditure.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Yet these innovation indicators are problematic on several counts. Firstly, R&amp;D
expenditure may be treated as an input that could eventually lead to an
innovation. However this expenditure does not directly measure the
production due to that innovation. Furthermore, this indicator excludes
a lot of innovation-related expenditure apart from R&amp;D expenditure, for
example expenditure on product design, experimental production, training
and investment in machinery related to the innovation. Finally, R&amp;D
expenditure is a good indicator with respect to certain aspects of
technological change, particularly in sectors of highly capital-intensive activity such as industry<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.
However, it tends to restrict the notion of innovation itself: R&amp;D
expenditure as an indicator involves the risk of underestimating
innovation in small firms where expenditure on non-R&amp;D innovation is
relatively higher.</p>
<p>Towards surmounting these problematic aspects, since 2005, the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in conjunction with the
European Union, has developed a set of complementary innovation
indicators. The aim is to measure directly the results yielded by
innovations (their output) instead of merely considering the inputs that
may lead to an innovation<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. These indicators are described in the
Oslo Manual (OECD 2010)<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> and were collected via the Community
Innovation Survey (CIS)<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> of EU firms, conducted every two years. Two
indicators in particular help identify technological innovations: first, the
implementation of product innovation, which consists in the introduction
of a new or significantly improved good or service, for example a
new model of a car or a cellphone<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. A second indicator is the
implementation of a process innovation, consisting in the implementation
of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method, for
example an improved assembly line production system or internet sales
delivery method. Non-technological innovations are also considered,
distinguishing within them organizational and managerial
innovations<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. These indicators help to adopt a more multidimensional
approach towards innovation: the focus is less on the role of
R&amp;D and science and technology, and more on the
multiplicity of actors involved in the process, in particular on the
role of employees and their skills development.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="the-different-levels-of-analysis-of-the-innovation-employment-relationship-sector-firm-worker-">The different levels of analysis of the innovation-employment relationship: sector, firm, worker &hellip;</h3>
<p>An analysis of the effects of innovation on employment raises the
question of the &lsquo;just&rsquo; measure of innovation. This question is in turn
related to the analytical level under consideration: should one estimate
the effects of innovation on employment at the level of a firm, a sector
of economic activity or at the macroeconomic level of a country? In
other words, on which level can and should one search for answers?<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> For the expected effects of technological innovation on employment are not the same on these different levels of analysis. The degree of
precision in the measurement of these effects also differs. Firm-level analyses can indicate the effects of innovation implementation on employment within a firm. Such analyses will not yield any information about
the effects on employment in other firms. Macroeconomic
analyses, by contrast, can give us information about the average, overall effect of
innovation on jobs (the creation or destruction thereof). The measure
here is, however, less precise since it is difficult to distinguish the
effects of innovation from those of the set of co-occurring
macroeconomic phenomena (Vivarelli, 2014).</p>
<p>Let us now consider the level of the firm in greater detail. Product innovations are supposed to favor
employment since they can lead to the creation of new markets and to an
increase in the range or quality of products. Process innovations, by
contrast, are often aimed at reducing labor. This is termed their
&ldquo;labor-saving effect.&rdquo; However, other factors may influence the
effects of these two types of technological innovation. For example, in case of a product innovation, substitution
effects (also known as cannibalization effects) may occur if consumers
buy the new product and simultaneously abandon the older versions. This
would entail a very slight effect, or even no effect at all, on the firm&rsquo;s
activity and employment. Furthermore, even if a firm markets a new
product and manages to increase both its total sales and its employee
numbers, the effects of the new product at the sectoral level could be
very different: for instance, one might observe an expansion of the
market with an increase in activity and employment within the innovative
firm but no change in the demand addressed to other firms. Further, the
sales of other firms could even drop if, for example, their clients turn
to the competing firm&rsquo;s new product. This is termed the &ldquo;business
stealing effect.&rdquo; Thus, innovation could have a positive effect on
employment in case of the firm concerned but no effect or even a
negative effect at the level of the market or the economic sector
concerned.</p>
<p>More generally, the effects of technological product and process
innovation on employment will depend on a set of institutional factors,
such as the degree of competition in goods markets, the elasticity of
demand, the mechanisms of wage adjustment, the bargaining power of
employees, and so forth (Calvino and Virgillito, 2017).</p>
<p>Consider next the macroeconomic level of analysis. It is particularly
difficult to analyze the effects of innovation on employment at this level. The reason
is that many factors change simultaneously. Historically, macroeconomic
analyses have generally served to analyze the effects of technical
progress. This brings us to Joseph Schumpeter&rsquo;s analyses and the
phenomenon of &ldquo;creative destruction&rdquo; that is peculiar to capitalism and
is related notably to the role of entrepreneurs: the appearance of new
products and processes destroys certain firms but also helps create
other, more productive firms in their stead. This analysis bears a close resemblance to
Alfred Sauvy&rsquo;s hypothesis in his theory of &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; (<em>déversement</em>)
as per which, with the introduction of technological innovations,
economic activity and employment are gradually &ldquo;discharged&rdquo; from one
sector to another&mdash;from a primary sector to a secondary sector, then to
a tertiary sector. Viewed within this optic at the macroeconomic level,
innovation engenders sectoral transformations and changes in skills
requirements rather than an overall destruction of employment.</p>
<p>Empirically, macroeconomic analyses generally affirm a positive
relationship between innovation and employment, and a hypothesis of
complementarity between machines and workers. For instance, the
widespread automation of production in the automobile sector has not
entailed a disappearance of employment in the sector. The reason is that
price decreases linked with increased productivity have fostered an
increase in demand. At the aggregate level, price decreases in one
sector, which help increase the disposable income of consumers, can also
entail an increase in demand in other sectors, the service sector, for
example. Empirical studies over the past several decades have confirmed
this positive relationship between innovation and employment,
which holds even if productivity gains lead to a feebler employment
increase than the increase in production. These analyses, which mobilize
R&amp;D expenditure in particular as a measure of innovation, form the basis
of the support for an increase in such expenditure at French and
European levels.</p>
<p>These analyses&mdash;whether old or recent, at different levels&mdash;all
confirm that innovation does not make employment disappear. They do
nevertheless raise questions about the evolution of the nature of
employment in the context of technological change.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="the-danger-of-an-increase-in-inequality-due-to-innovation">The danger of an increase in inequality due to innovation</h3>
<p>More than the disappearance of employment, it is the question of the
nature and quality of jobs created and destroyed by innovation that
merits consideration. The destruction and transformation of jobs can
affect workers quite differently, particularly depending on their skill
levels.</p>
<p>Two hypotheses have been advanced in the literature on the subject. The
first assumes that technological progress is biased in favor of the
highly skilled: jobs with lower skill requirements are lost while
skilled workers benefit from technological innovation. This hypothesis
is validated by numerous empirical studies conducted at the
macroeconomic level as well as by studies at firm and sector levels. In
the United States, R&amp;D and IT investments thus seem to have favored a
shift in the structure of employment towards the highly skilled (Autor
et al. 1998). One sees this in various European countries
too&mdash;France, the United Kingdom, Germany&mdash;even if here
again, the indicators that serve to measure the role of innovation are
relatively crude.</p>
<p>Another, more recent set of studies focuses on the alternative
hypothesis of job polarization (Goos et al. 2014). As per this
hypothesis, technological advances decrease the demand for &ldquo;middling
relative to high-skilled and low-skilled occupations&rdquo; (Ibid.: 2509).
In other words, middling occupations tend to be replaced by machines
while jobs situated at the two extremes tend to be preserved.
On the one hand, high-skilled jobs become more complex and important. On the other, nonroutine
low-skilled jobs are created that, being nonroutine, cannot be performed
by machines<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. These jobs involve interactional, manual,
non-repetitive, low-skilled tasks. Jobs at the low-skilled end of the
spectrum are also favored by the development of services, for instance
personal services in the context of an aging population, individual
services, and so forth. This polarization of jobs is observed mainly at
an aggregate macroeconomic level and is also related to factors other
than technological change, in particular changes in labor market
regulation that can favor the development of relatively low-skilled and
poorly paid service jobs or of international specializations due to
global trade (Ibid.).</p>
<p>These studies consider the manner in which technological change has
modified not only the quantity of jobs but also their quality. Such job quality changes can accentuate certain inequalities in the labor market.
Technological advances could thus degrade the quality of low-skilled
jobs and increase that of high-skilled jobs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exogenous growth theory states that economic growth arises due to
influences outside the economy. The underlying assumption is that economic
prosperity is primarily determined by external, independent factors as opposed
to internal, interdependent factors. [&hellip;] While both the exogenous and
endogenous growth models stress the role of technological progress in
achieving sustained economic growth, the former posits that technological
progress alone, outside of the economic system, is the key determinant in
maximizing productivity, whereas the latter suggests that an economy's
long-term growth is a byproduct of the activities within that economic system
that result in technological progress.&rdquo; (emphases added;

On sector (<em>secteur</em>) and industry (<em>industrie</em>), the following references were found:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A French government website cites the work of British economist Colin Clark and his three-sector model as the basis of the French usage of <em>secteur</em> in this context:
<br /> &ldquo;<em>Le secteur primaire regroupe l&rsquo;ensemble des activités dont la finalité consiste en une exploitation des ressources naturelles : agriculture, pêche, forêts, mines, gisements. Toutefois, selon le point de vue, les industries extractives peuvent aussi être classées dans le secteur secondaire.Le secteur secondaire regroupe l&rsquo;ensemble des activités consistant en une transformation plus ou moins élaborée des matières premières (industries manufacturières, construction).</em> <em>Le secteur tertiaire se définit par complémentarité avec les activités agricoles et industrielles (secteurs primaire et secondaire).</em>&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.vie-publique.fr/fiches/269995-les-grands-secteurs-de-production-primaire-secondaire-et-tertiaire">https://www.vie-publique.fr/fiches/269995-les-grands-secteurs-de-production-primaire-secondaire-et-tertiaire</a>

<p>As per Investopedia, the difference between industry and sector in
English in the context of economics is: <br /> &ldquo;the terms industry and sector
have slightly different meanings. Industry refers to a much more specific group
of companies or businesses, while the term sector describes a large segment of
the economy.&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/industrysector.asp">https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/industrysector.asp</a> )</p>
