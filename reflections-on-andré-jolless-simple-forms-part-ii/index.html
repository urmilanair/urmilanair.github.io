<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This is the second part of a critical review of 20<sup>th</sup>-century literary critic and art historian André Jolles&rsquo;s <em>Simple Forms</em> and his attempt at theorizing &ldquo;the totality of all literary art&rdquo;.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="continued-from-part-ihttpswwwaropefastenedbetweenfrreflections-on-andrc3a9-jolless-simple-forms-part-i">Continued from <a href="https://www.aropefastenedbetween.fr/reflections-on-andr%C3%A9-jolless-simple-forms-part-i/">Part I</a></h3>
<p>How does one study simple forms?</p>
<p>Methodologically, Jolles explains, we
must, perforce, begin with specific artworks, that is, finished literary
texts wherein simple forms manifest clearly, &ldquo;shimmering through the
developed literary form&rdquo; (ibid.: 46). Given this starting point, and the
need to <em>infer</em> simple forms from the more complex, extant literary
artworks, Jolles finds it necessary to distinguish three types of simple
forms: first, we have the <em>pure simple form</em>, which is associated with a
single mental disposition, such as the legend, which is associated with
the mental disposition of <em>imitatio</em>. This is the simplest, as it were,
simple form. Second, we have the <em>actualized simple form</em> which is
manifest singly and clearly in an artwork. It emerges under the sway of
a single mental disposition and is typically one of the sources from
which simple forms may be inferred. For example, the actualized simple
form of the legend is manifest in the <em>vita</em> or life history composed
about a saint. Third, we have the <em>derivative simple form</em>, which is a
more complex type of simple form. In this case, an element that does not
correspond to a particular mental disposition, nevertheless, takes on
the structure of the latter&rsquo;s corresponding simple form (ibid.: 86-87).
In such cases, the mental disposition of the simple form is &ldquo;shammed,
simulated&rdquo; within the derivative simple form. Derivative simple forms
are difficult to distinguish from actualized simple forms. Consider the
following example: the simple form of myth emerges under the sway of a
mental disposition involving the &ldquo;desire to understand the world, the
world as a whole and its phenomena, like the sun and the moon&rdquo; (ibid.:
78). Myth involves the verbal gestures of question and answer; the
question emerges from human experience of the world, and the answer is
revealed by the world. There are, however, derivative simple forms
wherein elements of the simple form of myth take on the structure of,
for example, the simple form of the fairy tale. One sees this in the
&ldquo;literary fairy tale&rdquo; (German <em>Kunstmärchen</em>; ibid.: 86-87). There,
elements of the simple form of myth (the question and answer verbal
gestures) are taken up within the structure of the fairy tale. Now the
mental disposition associated with the fairy tale has to do with naïve
morality (ibid.: 192). That the literary fairy tale involves a
derivative simple form may be understood from specific differences with
the actualized simple form of the myth. For instance, Jolles discusses
the literary fairy tale of how the bean came to have a black seam. In
this story, the answer comes not from nature or from the bean itself, as
it would in the simple form of the myth. (Briefly, the bean laughs at
the mishaps of its companions; it bursts at its seams and thus gets its
just desserts; a tailor sews it up with black thread, and beans have had
black seams ever since.)</p>
<p>As one continues the ascent through language&rsquo;s literary forms, from pure
to actualized to derivative simple forms and beyond, one arrives finally
at the pinnacle of linguistic creation, the literary artwork. This last
is composed by an individual author who essentially <em>executes</em> the
creative forces of language, appropriating available literary forms,
combining them at will, solidifying these combinations until her or his
unique voice seems to emerge within the literary artwork<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This, as
per Jolles, is how all literature is created, by the workings of
literary forms together with the more basic linguistic possibilities
furnished by the semantics and syntax of a given language.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>We have thus examined Jolles' conception of language, as possessed of
and structuring its own <em>Gestalt</em>. We have considered his notion of
simple forms, created in and by language under the sway of mental
dispositions, and composed of verbal gestures, each of which represents
a concept. Simple forms are authorless; they are not literary artworks
in themselves although they constitute the latter.</p>
<p>Jolles' model fascinates by virtue of its formalism, its attempt to
locate the evolution and creation of all literary artworks within
language itself. In this conclusion, we shall examine three problematic
aspects of this model<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>First, Jolles, in his final chapter, brings to the fore one of the
central problems with his notion of simple forms, constituted as they
are by verbal gestures. The problem is that a verbal gesture is
sometimes itself a simple form, as is the case with the simple form of
the saying. Yet, in other cases, such as those of the myth, the fairy
tale, etc. the simple form is made up of multiple verbal gestures. How
might one conceive of the distinction between simple form and verbal
gesture in light of this, particularly since a simple form is supposed
to develop under the sway of a single mental disposition? Interestingly,
the problem is reminiscent of one faced by folklorists in their attempts
at classifying folktales. Folklorists have, over the course of the
20^th^ century classified folktales in terms of idealized abstractions
termed <em>tale-types</em>, that are made up of <em>motifs</em>, the latter being the
narrative units of a tale-type. For example, the tale-type &ldquo;Carrying the
Sham-Sick Trickster: The fox shams sickness and is carried by the wolf&rdquo;
contains, among its several motifs, that of &ldquo;Disguise as a sick man &quot;
(Aarne and Thompson 1961: 22; Thompson 1955-1958: 1874). The most widely
used classification of tale-types is that of Antti Aarne and Stith
Thompson, referenced here, and known as the AT classification<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. In
parallel with it, Stith Thompson created a classification of motifs,
also referenced above. These two classificatory schemes, used by
folklorists the world over, have been troubled almost since their
beginnings by the fact that certain tale-types are themselves motifs,
although other tale-types involve successions of motifs in their plots.</p>
<p>A second problem that Jolles discusses arises on account of the
methodological need to infer simple forms from extant literary artworks.
Any simple form thus inferred, whether actualized (as a singly manifest,
readily discernible simple form) or derivative (manifest in a
transformed state due to a coupling of two or more simple forms),
inevitably contains transitional and connective elements. The question
that arises is: are these elements to be understood as verbal gestures
themselves, that is, as concepts that emerge within language under the
sway of a particular mental disposition, and that feature within a
specific simple form? Alternatively, did these transitional and
connective elements <em>accrue</em> to the original simple form along its way
towards becoming an actualized simple form, as the simple form of legend
is actualized in the <em>vita</em> or history of a saint&rsquo;s life? In the latter
case, these elements would constitute merely the &ldquo;means of
actualization&rdquo; of a simple form and would not be verbal gestures in
themselves. They would, that is, be unrelated to the mental disposition
under whose sway the simple form emerged in language.</p>
<p>Jolles' response to both questions appears in the last paragraph of his
oeuvre and strikes a plaintive note: &ldquo;Our study has thus to begin again
with the verbal gesture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third problem that Jolles does not himself bring up, and which is, in
fact, at the heart of the first two, is the following: Jolles speaks of
the creative force of language, whereby events of the manifold of human
experience are &ldquo;whirled&rdquo; and &ldquo;swirled together by language, condensed
and recast [&hellip;] in language as indivisible units impregnated and
charged by the mental disposition&rdquo; (ibid.: 215-216). This is how verbal
gestures are formed within language, which then come together in the
simple form. Subsequently, simple forms, whether actualized or
derivative, are available to authors, who may appropriate them at will,
thereby <em>executing</em> a literary work of art, whose <em>creation</em>,
nevertheless, remains the purview of language itself. The question
remains: we start with the materialities of language, on the sonic,
semantic and syntactic levels, and end up with a literary artwork &ndash; but
how? How precisely does Jolles' impressionistic swirling and whirling
occur in language, condensing and recasting verbal gestures into simple
forms under the sway of distinct mental dispositions, over and over
until a poet comes along, who takes up those condensations and
recastings and solidifies them anew, executing them into a literary
artwork? A robust theorization of these processes would probably resolve
the problem of the difference between simple form and verbal gesture, as
well as that of the transitional and connective elements encountered
within these forms.</p>
<p>One would need recourse to something like a Jakobsonian poetics to begin
to theorize this third problem. (Jakobson, of course, does not posit
links between the universe of linguistic codes and a manifold of human
experience within which certain mental dispositions emerge and hold sway
among certain sections of a populace.) Furthermore, Jolles' notion of a
smooth, stepwise ascent from the basic linguistic level to the level of
complex literary artworks would need conceptions such as Whorfian
fashions of speaking, Bakhtinian voicing and polyphony, not to mention
Silversteinian cultural concepts, intertextuality and interdiscursivity,
to theorize the whirling, condensing, appropriating and solidifying that
ultimately yields the authorial voice manifest in a literary artwork.
Jolles' stepwise ascent would, in short, need to be contextualized
ethnographically, in reliance on such theories that link sentence-level
structures with discourse-level structures of communication.</p>
<p>Pure linguistic formalism, shorn of thick description, seems merely to
end up swirling and whirling about after its own tail. Furthermore, any
such extension of Jollesian simple forms would inevitably problematize
his basic assumption of the systematicity of language and of the
manifold of human experience, since the models cited above locate
language use in the communicative act, in turn rooted in the flow of
culturally specific interaction. The impetus in such attempts is, of
course, always opposed to analytic reifications of culture. That,
however, is another project. Suffice it to that Jolles' project of
theorizing &ldquo;the totality of all literary art&rdquo; via the concept of simple
forms is magnificent in scope and ambition. Despite&ndash;or perhaps because
of&ndash;the questions they throw up, <em>Simple Forms</em> are &lsquo;good to think
with.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Jolles draws here on the distinction proposed by Jacob Grimm,
between natural poetry and art poetry (<em>Naturpoesie</em> and
<em>Kunstpoesie</em> in the German; ibid.: 177 ff.). The former emerges
from the human soul directly into words, while the latter is the
result of the artifices of a poet. Jolles, of course, adapts Grimm&rsquo;s
distinction to the systematic <em>Gestalt</em> of language and human
experience that he posits. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Frederic Jameson, in his foreword to the English translation,
poses a different set of questions, regarding the basic assumptions
of Jolles' model (Ibid. : ix ff.): can simple forms indeed make up a
system as Jolles argues? Is nine really the precise number of all
possible simple forms? Our questions here, by contrast, are
concerned more with the how-questions, of how the materialities of
language may work to create literary forms and literature (at the
levels of phonetics, semantics, grammar, and of texts built upon
these levels). <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>More recently the AT classification has been updated by
