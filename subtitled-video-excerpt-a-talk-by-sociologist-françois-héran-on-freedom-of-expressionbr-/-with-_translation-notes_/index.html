<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This video that I have subtitled in English is excerpted from <a href="https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/francois-heran/course-2020-10-30-10h30.htm">a talk in
French by François Héran</a>, sociologist and demographer. It focuses on the idea of freedom of expression (Fr. <em>liberté d&rsquo;expression</em>). The talk was addressed to history and geography teachers in France in the wake of the murder of Samuel Paty. Himself a
history and geography teacher, Paty had used caricatures of the
Prophet Muhammad in his class and was consequently killed by a young jihadist of Chechen origin.</p>
<p>Héran gave this talk on October 30, 2020, during his course on migration at the <em>Collège de France</em>. The talk lasts around fifty minutes. This video includes the six-odd minutes of its conclusion.</p>
<p>Héran&rsquo;s <a href="https://laviedesidees.fr/Lettre-aux-professeurs-d-histoire-geo-Heran.html">article on the subject</a> was published the same day in the online French journal <em>La Vie des Idées</em>, a publication of the <em>Collège de France</em>.</p>
<p>In March 2021, his book was published, titled <a href="https://www.editionsladecouverte.fr/lettre_aux_professeurs_sur_la_liberte_d_expression-9782348069277"><em>Lettre aux professeurs sur la liberté d&rsquo;expression</em></a> (2021, Paris: La Découverte, 252p.). In the book, he develops the various analytical threads that he presents in the article and the talk.</p>
<p>The title of the book in English would be <em>On Freedom of Expression: A Letter To Teachers</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the subtitles do not appear, please click on &ldquo;CC&rdquo; at the bottom right of the Youtube video. Once you have clicked on &ldquo;CC&rdquo; (which should then typically appear underlined, usually in red), the subtitles should appear when Héran speaks.</p>

<h3 id="two-translation-notes">TWO TRANSLATION NOTES</h3>
<p><strong>I. <em>The problem with “republican values”</em></strong></p>
<p>Héran uses the term “<em>les valeurs de la République</em>” several times. Possible translations of this would include:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>our republican values,</li>
<li>the republican values,</li>
<li>republican values,</li>
<li>Republican values.</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose the first translation:<br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong><em>les valeurs de la République</em></strong>” = “<strong>our republican values</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reasoning is as follows: in the mind of a hypothetical American viewer, each of the possible translations would inevitably involve a certain degree of interference with the American Republican Party and the values it represents.</p>
<p>The translation chosen avoids that interference maximally: Héran&rsquo;s subtitled &ldquo;our&rdquo; would invoke France and not the U.S.</p>
<p>This translation is, however, deeply problematic for the following reason: Héran’s critique is that people today&mdash;the French and the Islamic fundamentalists, both&mdash;seek actively to hide and forget the historical particularity of values. On the French side, people thus often view the “<em>valeurs de la République</em>” as impervious to time and space.</p>
<p>Now if the term &ldquo;<em>les valeurs de la République</em>&rdquo; is translated as “our republican values,” it then contains within itself, always and already, Héran’s critique: the translation prefigures the critique itself, given the presence of the particularizing possessive “our.”</p>
<p>This is extremely problematic. Nevertheless, I stuck with this translation, not having found a better solution, given the constraints of the subtitle form.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>II. <em>On the difficulties of subtitling subtle arguments</em></strong></p>
<p>The subtle complexity of Héran’s thought entails that the precise logical thread of his remarks is not always easily rendered in subtitles. For example, at 01:06 of the video, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>Les textes constitutionnels que j’ai cités ont beau évoquer le respect des croyances, on peut dire que les djihadistes ont atteint leur but : nous pousser à bout, ériger les caricatures en absolu, au risque d’isoler la France.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a written text, this could be translated, for instance, as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well may the constitutional texts I cited mention &lsquo;respect for all beliefs,&rsquo; the jihadists have attained their goal: they have pushed us to our limit, set up the caricatures in absolutist terms, such that France is in danger of being isolated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Héran elaborates on this point elsewhere in his talk, in a part not included in this video. In effect, he argues that the jihadists have succeeded in shifting the terms of the debate about caricatures so that the latter are now considered in Manichean, absolutist terms: the caricatures stand immutable, and one may either be for or against them. A more nuanced discussion&mdash;for instance of the artistic value of their drawing, of the quality of humor involved&mdash;is all but impossible today.</p>
<p>In adopting such an absolutist stance on the caricatures, the French must perforce go against their own constitutional and republican value of “respect for all beliefs”: one cannot simultaneously be pro-caricatures and respectful of the beliefs of those who are against them. The jihadists have thus attained their goal of undermining republican values in France.</p>
<p>These logic links of his argument are difficult to render in subtitle form.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, Héran’s formulation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>ériger les caricatures en absolu</em>” =<br />“establish the caricatures as absolutes&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the jihadists' goals he mentions, one that they have achieved. Crucially, the subject of the verb <em>ériger</em> in Héran’s sentence is the collectivity of jihadists: they are the ones who have succeeded in their goal of setting up the caricatures as absolutes.</p>
<p>I subtitled this sentence in English as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now the constitutional texts I cited may mention respect for all beliefs,</li>
<li>as does Article 1 of our Constitution.</li>
<li>Yet the jihadists have succeeded</li>
<li>in pushing us to our limit:</li>
<li>we exalt caricatures in absolute terms,</li>
<li>at the risk of isolating France.</li>
</ul>
<p>The subtitles thus involve significant departures from Héran&rsquo;s formulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>the verb &ldquo;<em>ériger</em>&rdquo; (meaning to erect, to establish, to set up) is changed to &ldquo;exalt&rdquo;;</li>
<li>the subject of the sentence and of this verb &ldquo;exalt&rdquo; is likewise changed: the subject is not a jihadist collectivity but rather the French.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without getting into the details of subtitling norms, suffice it to say that subtitles as a form involve a number of constraints: they have to be short, easy to read, they have to fit comfortably on the screen, flow smoothly, and so forth.</p>
<p>Towards satisfying the normative requirements of this form, I thus had to depart quite drastically from Héran&rsquo;s sentence, in order to retain his meaning.</p>
