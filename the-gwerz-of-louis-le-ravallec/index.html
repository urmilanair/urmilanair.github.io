<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This is my translation of ethnologue Donatien Laurent&rsquo;s seminal study of the <em>gwerz</em> of Louis Le Ravallec. A <em>gwerz</em> is a ballad form belonging to the oral traditions of Britanny. Laurent&rsquo;s article was published in 1967 in the journal <em>Arts et traditions populaires</em>. This is a partial translation, of pages 19-32 of his article. My thanks to Presses Universitaires de France for permission to publish this translation on my blog.</p>

Laurent, Donatien. <em>&ldquo;La gwerz de Louis le Ravallec&rdquo;</em>. <em>Arts et Traditions populaires</em>, no. 1. (January-March 1967): 19-79. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41001390">https://www.jstor.org/stable/41001390</a></p>

<h3 id="the-translation">The translation</h3>
<p>The informed reader, leafing for the first time through an anthology of
the Breton-language songs known as <em>gwerziou</em> and <em>soniou</em> [&hellip;], is
struck from the outset by certain characteristics that distinguish them
from folk songs in French. The latter, as P. Coirault has demonstrated,
present us with excessively typified characters with no real-life civil
status, within a general setting that is summarily traced. Breton songs,
by contrast, depict specific, clearly identified characters, within a
familiar, carefully delineated framework. To a French folk song&rsquo;s
&ldquo;wounded soldier returned from battle&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> or its &ldquo;damsel in her
garden,&rdquo; the Breton song responds with &ldquo;Marie Le Masson of Paimpol in
Goëlo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Annette Le Bail of Saint-Norvez.&quot;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The French folk song&rsquo;s
characters are anonymous heroes in universal circumstances; in Breton
songs, they are named individuals, engaged in concrete, richly detailed
actions.</p>
<p>Among these Breton songs, the <em>gwerziou</em> represent a particularly
original expressive form, being &ldquo;[s]omber songs, fantastic, tragic,
recounting tales of apparition, murder, infanticide, of deathly duels,
betrayal, kidnappings and violence of all sorts&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> [&hellip;]. They
comprise a distinctive class of Breton songs from oral tradition, and as
such deserve some elucidation<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The contents of the <em>gwerziou</em> are in general real events, or held to be
such, whose tragic nature or moral significance is highlighted by their
composers via simple yet effective techniques. Some of these <em>gwerziou</em>
have been transmitted from generation to generation without any loss of
their emotive force, the latter stemming at least as much from their
&ldquo;truth&rdquo; as from the vibrancy of their form. Without the possibility of
dating the event reported in the <em>gwerz</em> or of knowing the information
that the first composers had at their disposal, it is usually difficult
to figure out if the sung narrative owes more to a faithful memory of
the event or to an imaginative reworking. Nevertheless, every so often,
a clearer picture emerges. Such is the case with the <em>gwerz</em> of Louis Le
Ravallec: not only have I been able to retrieve, date and situate the
precise facts that inspired this <em>gwerz</em>, I have also, to an extent,
been able to evaluate the information that its composer must have had,
and trace its transmission over the centuries.</p>
<p>This <em>gwerz</em> tells of Louis Le Ravallec, a young man of Langonnet who,
returning one evening from the <em>pardon</em><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> of neighboring Saint-Fiacre
in Le Faouët, was murdered by his companions. It also tells of how the
relics of Saint Barbara that he carried upon his person preserved him
from death for a long while.</p>
<p>There are at present two published versions of this <em>gwerz</em>. [&hellip;]I
was fortunately able to find three other versions that remain in
unpublished, manuscript form. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>These five texts provided me with valuable information for the study of
the evolution of the <em>gwerz</em> over time, and I began to research what the
folk tradition had retained of the affair in the region where it had
taken place, and in areas nearby. Since 1962, I have thus been able to
find, in the course of a search that was neither systematic nor
exhaustive, some fifty-odd people capable either of singing a fairly
complete version of the <em>gwerz</em> and of commenting on it, or of
furnishing intriguing details about the tragic event.</p>
<p>I soon realized that although the best-known version of this <em>gwerz</em>&ndash;that of the <em>Barzaz-Breiz</em>&ndash;belonged to a controversial anthology, the
<em>gwerz</em> itself was nevertheless based on a real event regarding which
the oral tradition continued to preserve many memories. In 1963 I had
the good fortune to discover, at the departmental archives of Morbihan,
the complete case file of the criminal proceedings against the suspected
murderers of Louis Le Ravallec. I thus realized that the affair dated
back to the beginning of Louis XV&rsquo;s reign in the early 18<sup>th</sup> century.
The original investigation into the case had lasted four years but
brought little to light. The copious file, containing the depositions of
forty-four witnesses, reveals the state of information and the diverse
rumors that circulated back then. I also went through various other
handwritten sources: cadasters, notarial deeds and, above all, parish
registers, extremely well preserved by the commune of Le Faouët. These
furnish precious details about the families involved in this tragic
event.</p>
<p>This article sets out the results of my research and seeks to derive
insights from them. I shall first present, as succinctly as possible, my
findings regarding what the criminal proceedings tell us about the
affair. In the second part, I shall compare that information with
testimonies collected in the present, preserved and transmitted within
the oral tradition. I shall then present and analyze the actual <em>gwerz</em>
with which my research began, and which forms its core. Given the nature
of the material that I have collected, the fundamental question
informing this study is that of the <em>memor(ial)ization</em> of an event
within the ancient peasant milieu of Lower Brittany. I shall focus to a
greater extent on the special&ndash;and, as we shall see, essential&ndash;role
of the <em>gwerz</em> in this process, rather than on its particular aesthetic
characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="the-criminal-proceedings">The Criminal Proceedings</h3>
<p>The Departmental Archives of Morbihan contain a voluminous file of 534
handwritten pages, classified under file number 2944 of Series B, with
the heading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Criminal proceedings investigated and initiated by the Jurisdiction
and Barony of Le Faouët, at the behest of the <em>procureur fiscal</em><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>
of the same, and continued in the court and Seneschalty of Hennebont
at the behest of the Crown Prosecutor [<em>Monsieur le Procureur du
Roy</em>], plaintiff and accuser</p>
<p>Against</p>
<p>Noel Le Houarner, Laurent Rousseau, Michel Guillemot and Jean Le
Houarner, all defendants and accused of the murder of Louis Ravallec [<em>sic</em>],
the aforementioned Noel Le Houarner having requested the ratification
of letters of remission for said homicide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The file contains 95 documents, the first three of which indicate that
on April 26, 1732, Germain Tetrel, a peddler of Le Faouët, was
fishing in the river Ellé, at the bottom of a large meadow near the
Barregan mill, when he discovered the corpse of a drowned man that had
washed up on the bank. The owner of the field, who came running
immediately, recognized it as the body of a young man of Langonnet,
Louis Le Ravallec, who had been missing for twelve days, and whose
whereabouts were being sought. His father, Maurice Le Ravallec, had
questioned those of his son&rsquo;s friends who had been with the young man on
his last day, but in vain; he was searching the ponds of the area. As
soon as he was informed, the wretched father went to Barregan and spent
the night by his son&rsquo;s body. The very next morning, on April 27, he
went to the town of Langonnet to seek legal advice from the seneschal
under whose jurisdiction the town fell. He was thus not present in the
early afternoon of that day, when the corpse was fished out, the report
on this being the second document in the file. The seneschal of Le
Faouët, Guy Marie de Chemendy [&hellip;], the son and substitute of the
<em>procureur fiscal</em>, Jacques Nicolas Borré, accompanied by the sworn
surgeon, <em>Maître</em> Jacques Charpentier, the clerk, a notary who served as
a Breton interpreter, and two sergeants were present. Having arrived at
the bottom of the meadow, they found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;a large number of people who had assembled there from all over; and,
having approached [&hellip;] having found and seen the corpse, fully
dressed, lying face down in the water, with its back outside the water
and its head on the edge of said meadow, its upper jacket rolled up
over the back; and, having had the body pulled up onto the meadow and
turned over, having noted that said corpse was large in stature, with
black hair and beard, probably around thirty years of age, without a
cap, clad in a shirt and two jackets&ndash;a doublet of red serge and a
doublet of canvas on top of that&ndash;gray serge breeches, with cloth
stockings and gaiters on the legs, and sabots on the feet; and, having
examined the corpse, we did not find any external cause, because,
having undressed it completely, having ordered said Charpentier to
conduct an autopsy and open it up in order to ascertain the cause of
death, and he having performed this in our presence, these [&hellip;] he
showed us, and, having seen that the said corpse had no wound anywhere
on the exterior body, apart from a general swelling&hellip;&rdquo; [&hellip;].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of a long autopsy report, the sworn surgeon concluded that,
not having found &ldquo;any wound, fracture or break nothing could have caused
the death of the said Louis Le Ravallec but drowning due to having
fallen or having been thrown into the water, which I attest and report
to be true&hellip;&rdquo; [&hellip;].</p>
<p>This report was formally contradicted by the deposition of one Anne Le
Piouff, a spinner, who was present at Barregan when the corpse was
retrieved from the river. She stated that, having undressed the corpse
at the behest of the <em>procureur fiscal</em>, she saw:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;two wounds that seemed to her to be knife cuts, one on the right side
and the other on the neck on the same right side; and that, there was
something small embedded in the hole in the neck which she tried to
pull out, but that it was so sticky and deeply embedded that she could
not pull it out; that the lower abdomen and all parts were swollen and
completely black; that the shoulder appeared to her to be dislocated
on the same right side, the arm merely dangling, as if it were held in
place by nothing but skin; that the left side of the head was also
injured, and the skin open unto the skull; that the surgeon merely
glanced at the head and, having cut off all the hair, made an incision
around the chest and the stomach so as to open up the corpse, and then
left it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anne Le Piouff further stated that before the body was buried, she
sought out the surgeon and &ldquo;told him to pay attention to everything, and
to look at the entire corpse because she saw wounds and bruises, and
that there was even blood on the corpse&rsquo;s shirt; and that the said
surgeon withdrew saying: &lsquo;Well, that is nothing!'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne Le Piouff did not make this deposition until three years after the
event. It was, sadly, too late to confront the surgeon with it as he had
died in November 1733. When the judges of Hennebont, before whom the
case had been brought at the request of the victim&rsquo;s father, asked her
why she had not made a deposition earlier, she replied: &ldquo;that she had
been told that she would certainly be summonsed to testify, and that she
therefore did not have to submit her name [&hellip;] and that,
nevertheless, to her knowledge, she had not been hitherto summonsed&hellip;&rdquo;
[&hellip;]. In fact, the judges of Le Faouët seem to have carefully avoided
soliciting her testimony. [&hellip;] This is the first contradiction of
many in this case.</p>
<p>Maurice Le Ravallec apparently had good reason to think his son&rsquo;s death
had not been accidental. He filed a complaint on April 27 at Gourin
with a view to making the <em>procureur fiscal</em> of Le Faouët institute
legal proceedings. He submitted this complaint in the form of a
&ldquo;denunciation&rdquo; (<em>dénoncy</em>), thereby adopting a procedure that the
circumstances permitted him to select, and which had him financially
covered irrespective of the outcome of the proceedings [&hellip;]. Below is
the text [&hellip;]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Denunciation submitted to the <em>procureur fiscal</em> at the behest of
Maurice Le Ravallec.</p>
<p>April 27, 1732.</p>
<p>Regarding that which has come to the knowledge of Maurice Le Ravallec,
small landowner, residing in the village of Portzcoeul [<em>sic</em>] in the
parish of Langonnet: that on Easter Tuesday, one Louis Le Ravallec,
his son, went to the gathering at Saint-Fiacre in the parish of Le
Faouët to hear the sermon, as is customary on that day at said
Saint-Fiacre; and that, after having heard the sermon, one Yves
Broustal, of the village of Kerly near Saint-Fiacre in said Le Faouët,
invited the said Louis Le Ravallec and several others to dine at his
house, to which invitation Louis Le Ravallec assented; and after
having dined at the house of the said Broustal, he set off homeward;
and, before he arrived at the village of Penfel in said Le Faouët,
there must have been some sort of dispute with malign consequences,
for he was heard to cry out and beseech Saint Barbara for protection,
and this after the sun had set, at which time according to hearsay, a
voice was also heard calling in lugubrious tones, twice: &lsquo;Thomas,
Thomas&rsquo;; and, forthwith, a man was seen to flee by the wide road; and
from that moment, nobody has been able to find out what became of
Louis Le Ravallec, apart from the rumors that he had been killed on
coming from Kerly near Penfel, and that his corpse had been
transported and hidden. The officers of Justice may well imagine the
grief of Maurice Le Ravallec, father of the deceased, who was unable
to find his child until the twelfth day after the latter&rsquo;s death, and
that through a fisherman whom he did not know otherwise named Germain, of
the city of Le Faouët, who found the body yesterday at around three
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon on the great river of Baregant [<em>sic</em>]; and
since Maurice Le Ravallec, father of the deceased, is not in a
position to meet the costs needed for the prosecution of such a major
crime, he submits this denunciation before the Justice system,
adjuring <em>Maître</em> René Gabriel Borré, <em>procureur fiscal</em> of Le Faouët
to discharge his duties as expected; that the corpse of the said Le
Ravallec had been found within the jurisdiction of the Barony of
Barregant [<em>sic</em>], on account of which monitories be obtained so as to
arrive at the evidence mentioned above; and, towards this, I the
undersigned, Joseph Buisson, <em>huissier audiencier</em> [a Justice
official] of the royal seat of Gourin [<em>siège royal de Gourin</em>] and
residing in the city and parish there, at the behest of said Maurice
Le Ravallec, residing as stated above, do certify having declared to
the aforementioned Right Honorable Borré, <em>procureur fiscal</em> of Le
Faouët, that said Maurice Le Ravallec does not wish to seek criminal
indemnification [<em>être</em> <em>partie civile</em>] &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The judges of Le Faouët note in the report on the retrieval of the
corpse that &ldquo;Maurice Le Ravallec, father, did not present himself to
identify the said corpse and request its inhumation although he had been
informed the previous evening.&rdquo; They ordered that the corpse and all
vestiges of clothing be loaded onto a cart and taken to the Le Faouët
prison while awaiting Maurice Le Ravallec&rsquo;s deposition. This deposition
was made the next day before the seneschal of Le Faouët, who summonsed
Maurice Le Ravallec and showed him his son&rsquo;s corpse for identification.
However, the father refused to accept the corpse and abandoned it to the
Justice system for the latter to have it buried, which was done the
following day in the cemetery of Le Faouët. If I focus here on this
fact, which is, after all, a mere detail, it is because the absence of
Maurice Le Ravallec at the retrieval of the corpse, and the burial of
the young man outside his home parish, seem to have marked popular
sentiment profoundly. We shall see that traces of this event are to be
found as often in certain versions of the <em>gwerz</em> as in the commentaries
accompanying them [&hellip;].</p>
<p>On the morning of that very same day, April 28, the judges heard:
Yves Broustal of the village of Kerly, in whose home Louis Le Ravallec
had his last dinner; Jacques Prat, also of Kerly, who had received one
of young Le Ravallec&rsquo;s friends for dinner; and that friend himself, Noel
Le Houarner, of Villeneuve-Lohéac in Langonnet. It was in the latter&rsquo;s
company that Loeizik left Kerly to return home to Porsqueul, Loeizik
being the diminutive of Loeiz (or Louis) regularly used in the <em>gwerz</em>
to invoke its hero. We learn thus that about an hour before sunset,
Louis Le Ravallec went to fetch Noel Le Houarner from the house of
Jacques Prat. A quarter of an hour later, since they were still at
Kerly, Yves Broustal told them either to hurry up and leave or to spend
the night at his place. However, Loeizik replied that &ldquo;he could not do
that for fear of what his mother might say &hellip;&rdquo; They therefore
departed. As they were leaving the village, however, they met Charles
Troboul (we shall see below the significance of this information), who
took them to his father Sébastien Troboul&rsquo;s place for a drink of cider.
A short while later, they finally departed for Langonnet.</p>
<p>From Noel Le Houarner we learn little: he acknowledged having left Kerly
with Loeizik but, being &ldquo;a wine lover, he did not know what became of
the said deceased, Ravallec, and was not aware of any quarrel that the
deceased may have had with anyone&hellip;&rdquo; [&hellip;].</p>
<p>Very few witnesses presented themselves spontaneously in the days that
followed, and their depositions did not help the investigation. Thus, on May 15, following standard procedure, the <em>procureur fiscal</em>, at the
behest of the judges of Le Faouët, requested the Bishop of Quimper to
send out monitories through the parishes of Le Faouët, Langonnet, and
the parish of Le Saint [&hellip;], enjoining all those who
knew anything about the circumstances of the death of Louis Le Ravallec
to testify, under pain of the Church&rsquo;s censure. In this request, the
<em>procureur fiscal</em> summarizes the results of his investigation and adds:
&ldquo;Certain individuals have speculated that the horse that carried the
said deceased in the river after his death could equally serve another
purpose &hellip;&rdquo; [&hellip;]. I am at a loss as to how to interpret this
enigmatic statement, which could be an allusion to certain threats aimed
at discouraging possible witnesses in advance. A few days later
Monsignor Hyacinthe de Ploeuc granted the monitories.</p>
<p>Although the monitories were read over three consecutive Sundays at
Langonnet and Le Faouët, they only convinced one new witness to present
himself. This was F. L. Hellou, master tailor at Le Faouët, whose
deposition concerned rumors and not the facts themselves [&hellip;].
Furthermore, the judges waited a year to collect his deposition! The
monitories were followed a year later by a new publication of &ldquo;last
comminations&rdquo; [<em>réagraves</em>], threatening recalcitrant witnesses with the
horrors of excommunication. This time, two people submitted their names
at Langonnet, though none did so at Le Faouët. These testimonies brought
nothing new to the case.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>On August 27, 1733, the <em>procureur fiscal</em> had Noel Le Houarner
arrested, &ldquo;charged [&hellip;] with having committed or participated in the
homicide of Louis Le Ravallec&rdquo; [&hellip;]. However, the order was only
given on September 9, and when four sergeants went the next day to
the village of Villeneuve-Lohéac where Le Houarner lived they found only
his mother, who said she did not know where her son had gone.</p>
<p>Thus, on January 8, 1734, Maurice Le Ravallec addressed a new
petition &ldquo;to our Lords of <em>Parlement</em>&rdquo; [the High Court] to the effect
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;all the land cries for vengeance for this most terrible homicide,
that has been effectively sanctioned in the absence of any punishment
meted out by the judges. We may rest assured that all that they have
done thus far will serve only to prove their collusion with the
accused. The witnesses who have been heard avow that the facts have
not been reported as they had declared them. One person could scarcely
countenance having seen money change hands towards undermining the
investigation into this affair&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, Maurice Le Ravallec requested that the affair be sent
before the judges of Hennebont or of the presidial court of Quimper, or
&ldquo;a jurisdiction other than that of Gourin in which <em>Maître</em> Borré,
<em>procureur fiscal</em> of Le Faouët, serves as the substitute for the Crown
Prosecutor &hellip;&rdquo; [&hellip;].</p>
<p>This was, in effect, what was decided, and on June 17, 1734, the
<em>procureur fiscal</em> of Hennebont, Vincent Laigneau, upon receiving the
enforcement orders of the proceedings from the judges of Le Faouët,
declared himself to be &ldquo;extremely surprised to find the said enforcement
orders so poorly drafted [&hellip;] so that no faith could be accorded to
such procedures so devoid of form and authenticity&hellip;&rdquo; [&hellip;]</p>
<p>The new <em>procureur fiscal</em> proved more zealous than his colleague in Le
Faouët: a mere fifteen days after he received the enforcement orders of
the proceedings, Noel Le Houarner was arrested. Four months had not
sufficed for the judges of Le Faouët to find the latter! Le Houarner was
incarcerated in the prisons of Hennebont where the jailer, François
Poullain, promised that he would keep &ldquo;a good and sure guard [over
him], and feed him the King&rsquo;s bread.&rdquo; [&hellip;]</p>
<p>Two days later, on July 2, Noel Le Houarner was interrogated,
without much success: according to his account, he and Louis Le Ravallec
had traveled together without speaking to each other as far as the field
that overlooked the cross of Penfel. He had, however, continued alone as
far as the cross and had paid no heed to what became of his companion.</p>
<p>In March 1735, Noel Le Houarner obtained letters of remission from King
Louis XV. On May 12, he submitted a petition to the judges of
Hennebont, requesting them to &ldquo;ratify the said letters,&rdquo; so that he
might benefit from them. In this petition, he takes up once more his
narrative of the events of that Easter Tuesday evening. However, this
time, curiously enough, he agrees to many things that he had previously
denied or concealed. Thus it is that he recognizes&ndash;for the first time&ndash;that Louis Le Ravallec had accompanied him to the cross and had wished
to stop there. However, he had wanted to continue on his way, so that
&ldquo;they quarreled and wrestled and dealt each other several blows, after
which, the petitioner left the said Le Ravallec, who seemed to turn back
and take the road to Kerly&hellip;&rdquo;. However, he &ldquo;did not believe he had
dealt him any blow that could have caused his death&hellip;&rdquo; [&hellip;].</p>
<p>On July 9, after a final interrogation, the judges of Hennebont
ratified the King&rsquo;s letters of remission and freed Noel Le Houarner,
ordering him to &ldquo;offer the sum of six livres towards prayers to the Lord
by the Capucins of Hennebont, for the soul of said deceased, Louis
Ravallec, and towards payment for the expenses of this court, [he] was
to pay 792 livres, 12 sols, and 2 deniers&rdquo; [&hellip;].</p>
<p>The criminal proceedings would not make much more progress: on
August 29, 1736, after a fresh series of confrontations and a final
interrogation that yielded nothing new, the four remaining accused&ndash;Laurent Rousseau, Michel Guillemot, Yves and Jean Le Houarner [&hellip;]&ndash;were absolved and declared innocent.</p>
<p>After four years of proceedings, the mystery remained unsolved: on the
evening of the <em>pardon</em>, had Louis Le Ravallec been murdered or had he
drowned accidentally while returning home drunk? The witnesses had, as a
rule, been very circumspect. When confronted, all persisted with
affirmations that contradicted each other. Without offering complete
credence to Maurice Le Ravallec&rsquo;s accusations against the judges of Le
Faouët, it is clear that the latter were scarcely diligent in their
attempts at elucidating the affair, and that many points remained
obscure that could have been clarified with a few additional hearings or
confrontations of witnesses.<br/>

<p>Translator&rsquo;s note: The Breton term <em>gwerz</em> (and its plural
form <em>gwerziou</em>) remain untranslated here, with a view to indexing
the categorical specificity of the genre among oral traditions. The
songs themselves are often described as ballads, being a form of
&ldquo;traditional narrative poetry in the Breton language&rdquo; (Constantine,
<em>Breton Ballads</em>, 1).&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
