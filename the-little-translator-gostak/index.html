<h1 itemprop="name" id="title">The little translator who couldn&rsquo;t, or Can the gostak gyre?</h1>
<p><em>March 15, 2021</em></p>



<article itemprop="articleBody" id="content">
  <br/>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p><em>This is the story of a translator who was very short and once asked the
question: &ldquo;Can the gostak gyre?&rdquo;</em></p>
<br/>
<h3 id="the-story">The story</h3>
<p>There was once a translator who was very short. One day, she awoke from uneasy dreams to find herself posing the question: &ldquo;Can the gostak gyre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She identified as a literary translator. Her diminutive stature
entailed, of course, that she could not translate the works of tall
authors, owing to the absence of a sharedness of experience.</p>
<p>She had a number of other very particular attributes.</p>
<p>She identified as bicurious. She sometimes identified as female, sometimes as male, though never as
both or neither.</p>
<p>All this meant that she could not translate the writings of authors who
identified as: homosexual female, heterosexual male, heterosexual
female, homosexual male, transgender, bisexual &hellip; The list was quite
long.</p>
<p>It was, of course, the requirement of sharedness of identity between
translator and author that shaped the list. And this requirement is
readily understood. Recall, for instance, the fate of <em>Little
Women</em> in France. The dear old book was handed over for translation to
one of those terrifyingly distinguished nineteenth-century
<em>gentilhommes</em>, fairly wreathed in muttonchop whiskers. Forthwith, he
set about finding within it a character who resembled himself. Finding
such a character&ndash;a trifling sideshow in Alcott&rsquo;s story&ndash;he
displaced the doppelgänger into the limelight, naming the book <em>Les
quatre filles du Docteur March</em>.</p>
<p>Humanity has evolved since then,
though one has to wonder: what would the world look like if, say, a
Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak had adopted such post-Enlightenment mores?
Spivak, after all, identifies as heterosexual female. And yet, back in
the twentieth century, she had the chutzpah to translate heterosexual
men&ndash;and of hues across the spectrum at that!</p>
<p>Speaking of hues, the little translator&rsquo;s was hard to identify. For in
this regard she had to contend with the entailments of bilateral
descent. The latter, coupled with the diverse neolocal residential
choices of several ancestors, meant that she required not lineages but
pie charts to explain her origins. She was neither Black nor White,
scarcely passing muster as Olive.</p>
<p>These individuating factors only reduced her job possibilities.</p>
<p>The little translator spoke and read several languages but translated
from only two of them, towards a third. She avowed herself a &rsquo;native
speaker&rsquo; of this third, though her view was routinely contested. For
native speakerhood is not conferred on the basis of linguistic
competence and performance. No, native speakerhood is a function of
History, written as it is by the clamoring victorious.</p>
<p>Thus it was that paid translation work was rare, there being scarcely an
author with whom the little translator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/mar/10/not-suitable-catalan-translator-for-amanda-gorman-poem-removed">could claim a sharedness of identity and experience</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thephilosopher1923.org/essay-taiwo">Thus it was that our little translator couldn&rsquo;t</a>.</p>
<p>When she applied for a translation job, she sighed, &ldquo;I think I can&rsquo;t, I
think I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Endless days of radio silence followed. Then came the moment
of her final mutter: &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/mar/01/amanda-gorman-white-translator-quits-marieke-lucas-rijneveld">I thought I couldn&rsquo;t</a>.&rdquo; Thus did she live
out her days.</p>
<p>For well may <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2013/feb/15/mind-your-language-andrew-ingraham">the gostak distim</a>, it can never gyre or gimble in
the wabe. These remain forever the prerogative of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabberwocky">the slithy toves</a>.</p>
