<h3 id="biographical-note-on-edgar-morin">Biographical note on Edgar Morin</h3>
<p>Born in 1921, and renowned for his contributions to the fields of both
sociology and philosophy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Morin">Edgar Morin</a> is the holder of thirty-eight
honorary doctorates from universities across the world. The emeritus
research director of the French National Center for Scientific
Research (CNRS) is a prolific author whose writings include the treatise
<em>Method: Towards a Study of Humankind</em>, translated by J. L. Roland
Bélanger (Peter Lang, 1992, 435 pp.). The treatise is the first of six volumes
published in French under the title <em>La Méthode</em> (Seuil, 1977-2004). His
most recent work, written in collaboration with Sabah Abouessalam, is
<em>Changeons de voie. Les leçons du coronavirus</em> (Denoël, 160 pp.). The title
may be translated as <em>A Change of Path: Lessons from the Coronavirus</em>.
The book offers a contemplation of &ldquo;the world after&rdquo; (<em>le monde après</em>).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="the-interview">The Interview</h3>
<p><strong>It has been five years since the 2015 <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> and Bataclan
attacks. Yet the killings continue in France, in the name of a god. The
recent murder of high school teacher Samuel Paty, the stabbings in Nice,
are these signs of history repeating itself?</strong></p>
<p>Before I consider these tragic events, I think it is important that I
situate my perspective and render explicit &lsquo;from where&rsquo; I speak in this
interview&ndash;as was enjoined on one in the past.</p>
<p>As far as religion is concerned, I believe human minds create gods to
worship and obey. I am what one would call an agnostic. Or rather, I
think the mysteries of the universe elude our minds. I consider the
Bible&ndash;foundational text that it is of, Judaism, Christianity and
Islam&ndash;to be woven of legends and myths. The Gospels and the Quran are
equally, for me, half-legend, half-historic. I admire Jesus Christ
without believing in his resurrection.</p>
<p>I abhor the hatred aroused towards the impious, the non-believers, the
adherents of other faiths, when one religion is all-powerful, as is the
case today in Iran and Saudi Arabia. I abhor the restrictions it
imposes, particularly on women. This was true of Judaism in the past,
and it remains so among orthodox Jews. This was true of Christianity
for centuries. It remains true of numerous Muslim countries.</p>
<p>Yet, I do not confuse Islam with jihadism: the pious Muslim and the
murderous fanatic are worlds apart, as were St. Francis of Assisi and
Torquemada. The word <em>Islamism</em> obscures their myriad differences with
its exclusive focus on proselytism and the rejection of democracy and
secularism. Certainly, Sharia law is incompatible with the laws of a
secular Republic. However, the majority of French Muslims accept the
laws of the Republic, and the believers among them are all the more
peaceable in that they view their religion as one of peace.</p>
<p>Islam appears to the French to be a foreign religion. This it is, by
virtue of its origins and its language, Arabic. Nevertheless, Islam is a
Judeo-Christian religion: it is rooted in the Bible and considers Jesus
as one of its prophets.</p>
<p>I have a horror of all murderous fanaticisms, such as those that plagued
humanity in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and that take root anew in the guise of
traditional religious forms. I enjoy involved dialogues with believers
but would hate to offend them. My credo is: never offend or humiliate.
Respect for others requires that one never ridicule that which is sacred
to them. I do, nevertheless, arrogate to myself the right to critique
their convictions: respect for freedom includes respect for my freedom
of speech.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I feel the pain of Native Americans at the desecration
of their sacred sites by European colonizers. On the other hand, when a
religion is all-powerful and condemns as blasphemy any and all
disobedience, I side with the condemned. I am thinking here, for
instance, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-Jean_de_la_Barre">the Chevalier de la Barre</a>, the eighteenth-century
French nobleman who was tortured and beheaded for having refused to
salute a religious procession, or of <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2020/10/28/rushdie-charlie-paty-victimes-d-une-meme-offensive-planetaire_6057609_3232.html">the Ayatollah&rsquo;s fatwa against
Salman Rushdie</a>.</p>
<p>Whence the seeming paradox: I support the freedom of women to unveil in
Iran as well as the freedom of women to veil in France. This, then, is
&lsquo;from where&rsquo; I speak: I am neither Islamist nor leftist, but rather a
follower of Montaigne and Spinoza. Thus, I wish for us to examine the
present situation in all its complexity. Note that this does not in any
way attenuate the condemnation of the murderous fanaticism of Islamic
jihadists.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the republication of the caricatures of the
Prophet Mohammed, and of their use for pedagogic, political and
ideological ends?</strong></p>
<p>Let us begin by recalling that the caricatures of Mohammed were not a
French, but rather a Danish creation. These caricatures posit an
umbilical link between the Prophet, founder of Islam, revered by pious
Muslims, and the jihadist terrorists of today. Such a link is, at the
very least, debatable. These caricatures have not been reproduced in
liberal democracies such as the UK and the US, nor in Italy and Spain
where the law prohibits insults to religion.</p>
<p>Now the publication of caricatures of Mohammed is legal in France, even
if practicing Muslims consider it blasphemous: we have the right and
freedom to blaspheme. <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> only continues, and perhaps
amplifies, a long-standing French tradition of anticlericalism and
religious libertarianism, one that has flourished since the times when
the Church was powerful in our society. This tradition of
anti-Christianism has faded with the Church&rsquo;s acceptance of secularism
and is today obsolete.</p>
<p>The satirical weekly reproduced the caricatures in 2006, provoking a mix
of laudatory and critical reactions. Among the latter was <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/justice/article/2007/03/22/attendu-que-charlie-hebdo-est-un-journal-satirique_5976521_1653604.html">a complaint
lodged by Muslim associations, which was rejected after a trial in
2007</a>. In 2011, the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> premises suffered an arson
attack which was later forgotten.</p>
<p>The 2015 attacks engendered a shift in the meaning of both the weekly
itself, and of the caricatures: <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> was no longer a
satirical magazine but rather a symbol of freedom of expression. The
journalists assassinated became, and rightly so, martyrs to liberty. And
the Danish caricatures were incorporated into the French national
heritage.</p>
<p>Then, during the trial of the perpetrators of the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>
attacks, the magazine decided to republish the caricatures. This
republication became even an epitome of French freedom, and their
diffusion became a salutary defense of critical thinking.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/education/article/2020/11/18/je-ne-ferai-plus-de-sequence-sur-ce-theme-dans-ses-derniers-messages-a-sa-hierarchie-et-ses-collegues-le-desarroi-de-samuel-paty_6060135_1473685.html">One teacher, high on freedom, thought of using the caricatures to
cultivate critical thinking among his students</a>. Initially, this
did not incite much of a reaction, apart from a complaint by one Muslim
father, and an appeasement, apparently successful, by the school&rsquo;s
headmistress. However, a mosque preacher stoked the embers, rekindling
them to the point of provoking a young Chechen to perpetrate the
gruesome jihadist action of beheading.</p>
<p>This murder provoked <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2020/10/17/apres-l-attentat-de-conflans-le-choc-des-professeurs-d-histoire-geographie-enseigner-la-liberte-d-expression-on-le-fait-tous_6056369_3224.html">a strong emotional reaction among
teachers</a>, and across French society. It unleashed denunciations of
the government, as being soft on such crimes, and of Islamo-leftist
indulgence. Note, incidentally, that the latter is an imaginary
construct uniting two terms, both of which are considered horrific.
President Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed the fundamental Republican value of
freedom and ended his speech&ndash;as per the version circulated by the
media&ndash;with the promise that France would defend the caricatures, as
if that were some sort of national duty. He subsequently denied and
softened his stance in <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2020/10/31/pour-l-archeveque-de-toulouse-on-ne-se-moque-pas-impunement-des-religions_6058021_3224.html">an interview with the Arab television channel
Al-Jazeera</a>, where he affirmed that he understood how the
caricatures might shock some people.</p>
<p><strong>After the initial shock and the unanimous condemnation of the attacks,
critiques began to emerge of the transformation of the Danish
caricatures into a national emblem of French identity. Are these
critiques valid?</strong></p>
<p>The horror of the beheading of the teacher Mr. Paty, after that of the
<em>Charlie Hebdo</em> attacks&ndash;by virtue of its palpability, its cruelty,
and its sheer madness&ndash;has obscured an important part of the reality
from which it emerged. The sheer horror of the crime disallows any
attempt at reflection and contextualization. It is as if such attempts
themselves involved the sin of justifying the crime. Yet, we must not
forget that such caricatures shock pious Muslims. Worse yet, these
caricatures have provoked acts of murderous insanity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sanctioning of the caricatures has provoked
innumerable, frenzied anti-French protests across the Islamic world.
While there are certainly instances where one must, perforce, brave the
incomprehension of others, there are equally instances where one does
better not to provoke or excite that incomprehension, especially in
times of extreme international tension.</p>
<p>One has to be careful of the possible perverse effects of
well-intentioned actions. There is sometimes <em>a contradiction between
freedom and</em> <em>responsibility</em> of speech or writing; this is one such
instance, and we must know that our choice involves a risk. There is
sometimes <em>a coincidence between responsibility and irresponsibility</em>.
Thus, it seems to me irresponsible to assume the responsibility of
supposing that the propagation <em>ad infinitum</em> of <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2020/10/21/au-danemark-jyllands-posten-ne-republiera-pas-les-caricatures_6056843_3210.html">the Danish
caricatures</a> represents the heart of French freedom.</p>
<p>In my view, and this is an idea that I develop in the fifth volume of my
treatise <em>La Méthode</em> (The Method), ethics cannot be restricted to good
intentions. Instead, ethics must involve a sense of the consequences of
one&rsquo;s actions, these consequences being often contrary to the intentions
underlying one&rsquo;s actions. Above all, any decision taken in an uncertain,
conflictual context involves the risk of engendering contrary effects.
Thus, we cannot judge the caricatures exclusively by the liberating or
religious libertarian intentions of their authors and broadcasters.
These caricatures must equally be judged based on the possibilities of
their harmful or disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Freedom of expression must not exclude the prevision of
misunderstandings, incomprehension, violent or criminal consequences
that it can provoke. Can these caricatures cause believers to doubt
their beliefs? Absolutely not. Can they contribute to the weakening of
jihadism? Absolutely not.</p>
