<h3 id="biographical-note-on-edgar-morin">Biographical note on Edgar Morin</h3>
<p>Born in 1921, and renowned for his contributions to the fields of both
sociology and philosophy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Morin">Edgar Morin</a> is the holder of thirty-eight
honorary doctorates from universities across the world. The emeritus
research director of the French National Center for Scientific
Research (CNRS) is a prolific author whose writings include the treatise
<em>Method: Towards a Study of Humankind</em>, translated by J. L. Roland
Bélanger (Peter Lang, 1992, 435 pp.). The treatise is the first of six volumes
published in French under the title <em>La Méthode</em> (Seuil, 1977-2004). His
most recent work, written in collaboration with Sabah Abouessalam, is
<em>Changeons de voie. Les leçons du coronavirus</em> (Denoël, 160 pp.). The title
may be translated as <em>A Change of Path: Lessons from the Coronavirus</em>.
The book offers a contemplation of &ldquo;the world after&rdquo; (<em>le monde après</em>).</p>
<br />
<h3 id="the-interview-part-ii">The Interview, Part II</h3>
<p><strong>We have heard writers and polemicists as well as ministers support the
view that &ldquo;Islamo-leftism&rdquo; helps arm terrorism intellectually. Is this
charge justified? Why is this ideological offensive occurring?</strong></p>
<p>What is truly terrible is that this affair has amplified the progress of
Manichaean, unilateral, reductive thinking. Any resistance towards a
growing Islamophobia comes to be viewed as a sign of abject
Islamo-leftism or even of complicity with the murderers. Of course,
Islamo-leftism is neither Islamic nor leftist. And, unfortunately, as in
1914, in 1933, in 1940, as at every moment of collective frenzy, there
are philosophers at the forefront of the hysteria.</p>
<p>Most dangerous of all is the fact that, as has happened several times in
the past, France is divided against itself. In the best of cases, as at
the start of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, a Republican and secular France
vanquished a monarchical, Catholic and conservative France. In the worst
of cases, as in 1940, a reactionary France prevailed, fostering a
military disaster.</p>
<p>The lockdown has imposed a provisional freeze on the conflict which
would otherwise have exploded in France. What will happen after the
lockdown ends? What new political decompositions and recompositions
might we anticipate? An identitarian France already stands in opposition
to a humanist France. All this merits not imprecation, but rather
examination and reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Does the United States, divided as it stands today, foreshadow the
conflict between these two opposed Frances during the next presidential
elections?</strong></p>
<p>As of right now, we do not know if, after Joe Biden&rsquo;s victory, Donald
Trump is going to attempt to stage a coup to hold on to the presidency.
Tensions are high in the U.S. and I do not know if we will see an
explosion or a slow pacification.</p>
<p>On this side of the Atlantic, for the moment, the two Frances have not
yet crystallized. There will be further political decompositions and
recompositions. I can well imagine the possibility of a political
movement built around public welfare, which would unite the
well-intentioned across the board, in search of a new economic, social
and ecological way. However, I do not see it embodied at present, not in
any organization, nor in any political leader. On the left, I see
muddled attempts at regroupment. By contrast, I see the possibility of
the emergence of an outsider representing order and discipline, that is
to say, the other France, someone like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/19/head-of-french-military-quits-after-row-with-emmanuel-macron">General Pierre de Villiers</a> for example.
However, nothing is certain, and we definitely have many a surprise in
store for us next year.</p>
<p><strong>How do we avoid such dislocation?</strong></p>
<p>As an adolescent, I was a member of a small party called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Frontist_Party_politicians"><em>Mouvement des étudiants frontistes</em></a> (Frontist Students Movement) that fought on two fronts simultaneously,
against fascism and against Stalinism. Under the Occupation, I became a
Communist. Six years later, I gave up my Communist leanings and found
myself once again engaged in a fight on two fronts, against
Soviet-style communism and against European colonialism. For decades, I
have striven against two seemingly opposed forms of barbarism, the
barbarism of hatred, domination and contempt that emerges from the
depths of historical time, and the icy cold barbarism of our
civilization, of the hegemony of unfettered profit and calculation. I
was able to resist the war hysteria that criminalized all Germans, then
the hysteria of Stalinism that criminalized all criticism of communism,
and I shall resist the new forms of hysteria.</p>
<p>In France today, I see the need to fight on two fronts: on the one hand,
against xenophobia, racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism, those barbarisms
of modern civilization, and on the other, against murderous
fanaticisms that contain within themselves all the ancient barbarism.
The fight on this second front involves, obviously, the suppression of
murderous violence. It also involves the prevention of such violence.
This prevention would require policymaking on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banlieue"><em>banlieus</em></a>, the
reduction of social and economic inequality and the revival of a
humanist education.</p>
<p><strong>What is to be done in schools specifically, in the realm of
pedagogy?</strong></p>
<p>It is in this respect that I have proposed, since the emergence of
Islamic terrorism, that the prerequisites of critical thinking be
integrated into school curriculums.</p>
<p>The first prerequisite is the capacity <em>to question the world</em>. This is
very present among children but can weaken with age. It must be
encouraged.</p>
<p>Once the desire to question the world is stimulated, it is necessary to
foster the act of <em>problematizing</em>. Problematizing serves to question
things that may seem absolute to us, whether they are natural &lsquo;verities&rsquo;
(such as the sun&rsquo;s apparent movement around the earth), or cultural and
social &lsquo;necessities&rsquo; (such as a dictatorial power&rsquo;s legitimacy, the
belief in racial superiority). Let us remember that problematizing the
world was the key virtue of the European Renaissance from which science
emerged. It was from problematizing God that philosophy took wing.
Problematizing all authoritative judgment resulted in the spirit of
democracy and the citizen. It is in such problematizing that secularism
has its roots.</p>
<p>Critical thinking thus requires a robust capacity to question the world
and to problematize. Critical thinking also requires the capacity for
self-scrutiny that schooling must stimulate, so that every student is
capable of the reflexivity that affords <em>self-critique</em>. Critical
thinking without self-critique risks falling into an uncontrolled
critique of all that is outside oneself. What would critical thinking be
without self-critique?</p>
<p>Critical thinking necessarily requires a rational mind, that is, a mind
capable of applying induction, deduction and logic in any examination of
facts or data. The rational mind equally requires a consciousness of the
limits of logic in the face of realities that can only be recognized by
accepting their contradictions or by associating antagonistic terms.</p>
<p>Critical thinking thus nurtured by all these prerequisites can and
should be exercised freely. However, it must also involve the capacity
to critique critique itself, when the latter becomes intemperate or
focuses only on the bad aspects of phenomena, realities or ideas.
Finally, the teaching of critical thinking will involve the critique of
teaching itself. Thus, critical thinking involves an entire intellectual
infrastructure that is generally ignored.</p>
<p><strong>These are major reforms, beginning with the reform of ways of
thinking. Do you think they are achievable?</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned, the conjuncture is regressive. Extant antagonisms only
reinforce each other. I never cease to recall that the previous two
decades involved grave regressions on political, economic, social,
ethical and intellectual fronts: a generalized crisis of democracy;
fresh persecutions of religious minorities (in China, in India); the
hegemony of profit; economic ravages that incited popular revolts (all
of these suppressed, as in Algeria and Belarus); the domination of a
certain type of thinking, based on calculation and hyperspecialization,
that renders us incapable of conceptualizing and understanding the
complexity of human problems, whether on an individual, national or
planetary scale.</p>
<p>We do not know if the new American presidency will help decrease the
antagonism between the U.S. and China and the tensions between the
ayatollahs' Iran and the U.S.-Israeli-Saudi Arabian coalition. Turkey
has become a force of Islamic interventionism in the Mediterranean.
China&rsquo;s imperialist tendencies are destroying Hong Kong&rsquo;s autonomy and
producing conflict with India. An ethno-religious war has broken out
between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The crisis of the plural Lebanese state
continues. Arms races break out everywhere. Europe is unable to overcome
its disunion.</p>
<p>Hopes wane of a great ecological awakening, of a grand reform of the
globalization that has created a generalized interdependence without
solidarity. Rather than a fallback to a past status quo, we witness a
process of regression. The impetus is feeble towards a renaissance of a
political thought that would show us a new democratic, economic and
ecological way.</p>
<p>Instead, Manichaean thinking and fanaticisms are on the rise.
Nationalism and racism worsen. And simultaneously, global warming
intensifies the crisis of the biosphere which will compound humanity&rsquo;s
crisis. Indeed, we are in the midst of a massive planetary crisis of
biological, economic, civilizational and anthropological dimensions. It
impacts all nations and all of humanity.</p>
<p>Now, I have often said that a crisis provokes, on the one hand,
creativity and the imagining of novel solutions and, on the other, fear
and anguish that favor regression and dictatorships. If the great
regression continues, we are headed towards post-democratic systems
equipped with multiple means of controlling people, techniques that are
already in place within the Chinese model.</p>
<p>The probable course of events is extremely worrying. One cannot even
exclude the hypothesis of an upheaval that becomes generalized, such as
an accident of the type that occurred in Sarajevo, involving new modes
of warfare conducted from computers, by hacking the networks of enemy
states, via robot battles and, worse, nuclear missiles. However, the
improbable may yet alter the course of history.</p>
<p><strong>Can we make the improbable happen in France?</strong></p>
<p>I believe in the need to organize and to unite oases of resistance, of
life and thought that would continue to hold out the possibility of a
change of course. We must not ourselves lapse into the thinking we
denounce. I lived through the somnambulism of the disastrous 1930s.
Today, the perils are very different but are, nonetheless, huge. We are
subject to a new somnambulism. Heraclitus once formulated it thus:
<em>awake, they sleep</em>.</p>
