        This is my translation of an article written by the mathematician Michèle Vergne. In it, Vergne reflects on her youth and how she became a mathematician in a sexist world. There are no stories of violence or male brutality to be had here. Vergne writes instead of the winsome face of patriarchy, a face only too familiar to those who have marked their growth years in books, from Austen to Zola, from Laura Ingalls Wilder to Anna Karenina. Indeed, this face is familiar to anyone who has lived in a state of society. This is the second part of my translation of the article.

This is the second part of my translation of Ecalle&rsquo;s article. Ecalle discusses here his assertion that the notions of a social security balance and debt have little meaning in the present.

        This is my translation of an <em>analytical note</em> written by François Ecalle on the French blog Fipeco, devoted to analyses of public finance and the economy in France. Ecalle focuses in this article on the French social security system and its deficit. He traces the system&rsquo;s historical roots in two distinct models, and attributes some of its inconsistency and impenetrability to the shifting mix of the two over time. This is the first part of my translation of the article.

        I subtitled this video of an interview with renowned French mathematician Claire Voisin. In it she reflects on how she came to study mathematics, on its boundless nature, on the inadequacies of math teaching in schools, and on the experience of doing mathematics. What fascinates me is the way mathematicians often seem to anthropomorphize their own mathematical thought processes. Ramanujan famously attributed his mathematical insights to a goddess. Voisin here speaks of an &ldquo;ideal person&rdquo; inside herself who seems to do mathematics even as she performs banal chores.

        This video that I have subtitled in English is excerpted from a talk in French by François Héran, sociologist and demographer. It focuses on the idea of freedom of expression (Fr. <em>liberté d&rsquo;expression</em>). The talk was addressed to history and geography teachers in France in the wake of the murder of Samuel Paty. Himself a history and geography teacher, Paty had used caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in his class and was consequently killed by a young jihadist of Chechen origin. Héran gave this talk on October 30, 2020 during his course on migration at the <em>Collège de France</em>.
