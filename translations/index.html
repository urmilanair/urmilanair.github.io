        This is my translation of excerpts from an essay written by the poet Alain Borne on the postman Ferdinand Cheval&rsquo;s Ideal Palace, describing and analyzing that uncanny monument and its equally mysterious creator. Borne&rsquo;s essay, written in the first half of the twentieth century, was re-published this year together with the writings of Cheval, in the form of a book titled  <em>The Postman Cheval and his Ideal Palace</em> (<em>Le Facteur Cheval et son Palais Idéal</em>).

        One day in 1879, Joseph Ferdinand Cheval, a rural postman, decided to build himself a palace. He began to gather stones during his daily rounds and bind them together using lime, mortar and cement, drawing inspiration eclectically&mdash;from religions, history and imagery from across the world. Some three decades later, his Ideal Palace (<em>Palais Idéal</em>) was complete. People thought him insane and he often concurred with them. It was only near the end of his life that his chef-d&rsquo;œuvre was recognized as such, by figures such as André Breton, Anaïs Nin and Pablo Picasso among others. This is the second and final part of my translation of Cheval&rsquo;s autobiography.

        I subtitled this video of an interview with renowned French mathematician Claire Voisin. In it she reflects on how she came to study mathematics, on its boundless nature, on the inadequacies of math teaching in schools, and on the experience of doing mathematics. What fascinates me is the way mathematicians often seem to anthropomorphize their own mathematical thought processes. Ramanujan famously attributed his mathematical insights to a goddess. Voisin here speaks of an &ldquo;ideal person&rdquo; inside herself who seems to do mathematics even as she performs banal chores.

It focuses on the idea of freedom of expression (Fr. <em>liberté d&rsquo;expression</em>). The talk was addressed to history and geography teachers in France in the wake of the murder of Samuel Paty. Himself a history and geography teacher, Paty had used caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in his class and was consequently killed by a young jihadist of Chechen origin. Héran gave this talk on October 30, 2020 during his course on migration at the <em>Collège de France</em>.

        This is my translation of an article by French geographer Pierre de Potestad. The article traces the history of itinerancy and itineraries along the slopes of Mont Blanc. The article and translation were published in 2021 in the online journal <em>Révue de géographie alpine</em>, the Journal of Alpine Research.
