      <description>This is my translation of a &lt;em&gt;Commentary on Current Affairs&lt;/em&gt; written by François Ecalle on the French blog Fipeco, devoted to analyses of public finance and the economy in France. Ecalle here discusses the formula for a debt-stabilizing primary balance and the limits to a stable public debt. This is the third part of my translation of Ecalle&amp;rsquo;s article.</description>

      <description>This is my translation of a &lt;em&gt;Commentary on Current Affairs&lt;/em&gt; written by François Ecalle on the French blog Fipeco, devoted to analyses of public finance and the economy in France. Ecalle here explains that public debt cannot increase ceaselessly and discusses the stabilizing of the debt-to-GDP ratio as a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for debt sustainability. This is the second part of my translation of Ecalle&amp;rsquo;s article.</description>

Ecalle begins here his discussion of how one might understand public debt, and whether or not it ought to be limited.

      <description>This is my translation of several more excerpts from an essay written by the poet Alain Borne on the postman Ferdinand Cheval&amp;rsquo;s Ideal Palace, describing, imagining, analyzing that uncanny monument and its equally mysterious creator. Borne&amp;rsquo;s essay, written in the first half of the twentieth century, was re-published this year together with the writings of Cheval, in the form of a book titled  &lt;em&gt;The Postman Cheval And His Ideal Palace&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Le Facteur Cheval et son Palais Idéal&lt;/em&gt;).</description>

      <description>One day in 1879, Joseph Ferdinand Cheval, a rural postman, decided to build himself a palace. He began to gather stones during his daily rounds and bind them together using lime, mortar and cement, drawing inspiration eclectically&amp;mdash;from religions, history and imagery from across the world. Some three decades later, his Ideal Palace (&lt;em&gt;Palais Idéal&lt;/em&gt;) was complete. People thought him insane and he often concurred with them. It was only near the end of his life that his chef-d&amp;rsquo;œuvre was recognized as such, by figures such as André Breton, Anaïs Nin and Pablo Picasso among others. This is the second and final part of my translation of Cheval&amp;rsquo;s autobiography.</description>

      <description>This is my translation of a talk by the mathematician Michèle Vergne. In it, Vergne reflects on her youth and how she became a mathematician in a sexist world. There are no stories of violence or male brutality to be had here. Vergne writes instead of the more winsome face of patriarchy&amp;mdash;a face that is, in fact, only too familiar to anyone who has lived in a state of society. This is the third and final part of my translation of the talk.</description>

This is the final part of my translation of Ecalle&amp;rsquo;s article. Ecalle discusses here his propositions for possible modifications to the French social security system&amp;rsquo;s financing, with a view to clarifying the categories of its balance and deficit.</description>

      <description>This is my translation of an &lt;em&gt;analytical note&lt;/em&gt; written by François Ecalle on the French blog Fipeco, devoted to analyses of public finance and the economy in France. Ecalle focuses in this article on the French social security system and its deficit. He traces the system&amp;rsquo;s historical roots in two distinct models, and attributes some of its inconsistency and impenetrability to the shifting mix of the two over time. This is the first part of my translation of the article.</description>

      <description>This is my translation of a talk by the mathematician Michèle Vergne. In it, Vergne reflects on her youth and how she became a mathematician in a sexist world. There are no stories of violence or male brutality to be had here; Vergne writes of the winsome face of patriarchy. This is a face only too familiar to those who have marked their growth years in books, from Austen to Zola, from Laura Ingalls Wilder to Anna Karenina. Indeed, this face is familiar to anyone who has lived in a state of society. This is the first part of my translation of the talk.</description>

      <guid>https://www.aropefastenedbetween.fr/subtitled-video-an-interview-with-claire-voisin-mathematician/</guid>
      <description>I subtitled this video of an interview with renowned French mathematician Claire Voisin. In it she reflects on how she came to study mathematics, on its boundless nature, on the inadequacies of math teaching in schools, and on the experience of doing mathematics. What fascinates me is the way mathematicians often seem to anthropomorphize their own mathematical thought processes. Ramanujan famously attributed his mathematical insights to a goddess. Voisin here speaks of an &amp;ldquo;ideal person&amp;rdquo; inside herself who seems to do mathematics even as she performs banal chores.</description>

      <description>This video that I have subtitled in English is excerpted from a talk in French by François Héran, sociologist and demographer. It focuses on the idea of freedom of expression (Fr. &lt;em&gt;liberté d&amp;rsquo;expression&lt;/em&gt;). The talk was addressed to history and geography teachers in France in the wake of the murder of Samuel Paty. Himself a history and geography teacher, Paty had used caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in his class and was consequently killed by a young jihadist of Chechen origin. Héran gave this talk on October 30, 2020 during his course on migration at the &lt;em&gt;Collège de France&lt;/em&gt;.</description>
