<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Deverbalization is a mysterious&mdash;one might even say liminal&mdash;stage that translation theorists have argued occurs during translation. It was the interpreter and translator Danica Seleskovitch who presented the most compelling discussion of this idea, arguing that deverbalization (Fr. <em>déverbalization</em>) is an intermediate stage of any act of translation. During deverbalization, she asserted, the meaning of the source text that the translator has comprehended is stripped of its linguistic form; it is deverbalized before it may be re-expressed in the target language. Reflexive translators will no doubt attest to some such experience in their translation practice. I wrote this paper with a view to thinking through this mysterious notion&mdash;towards verbalizing deverbalization as it were.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>The interpretive theory of translation (<em>théorie interprétative du sens</em>) was founded at ESIT in Paris in the 1960s. Its point of departure
lay in a critique of structural linguistics that dominated back then,
focusing on autonomous, systemic conceptions of language, to the
exclusion of language as used. Starting instead from experience, the
interpretive theorists proposed a three-stage model of translation and
interpretation, with a mysterious intermediate stage that they named
deverbalization, in which meaning (<em>sens</em>) was divested of linguistic
form. The paths taken and eschewed have shaped the theory&rsquo;s development,
and have resulted in a present-day impasse: the theory is unable to
conceptualize adequately its most compelling concept, that of
deverbalization. Tracing a critical history of the theory, this article
proposes a new path, towards theorizing deverbalization. Drawing on
Jakobsonian and semiotic critiques of autonomous, systemic language
models, the article aims to aid translators in their evaluation of
translational choices, by furnishing them with adequate conceptual tools
rooted in interpretive theoretical and semiotic traditions.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<em>De l&rsquo;expérience aux concepts</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;From experience to concepts&rdquo;) is the
title of one of Danica Seleskovitch&rsquo;s seminal articles on the
interpretive theory of translation<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. An interpreter and translator,
Seleskovitch put forward the theory in the face of prevailing linguistic
theories focused on systemic conceptions of language and disregarding
entirely language-in-use, the necessary object of study of any
translation theorist. Thus it was that Seleskovitch, followed by her
colleagues and students at the <em>École Supérieure d&rsquo;Interprètes et de
Traducteurs</em> (ESIT) in Paris, rejected those dominant linguistic
approaches in favor of experience as a point of departure towards
concepts adequate to theorizing the practice of translation and
interpretation, with the aim of aiding practitioners of these two
métiers<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One of Seleskovitch&rsquo;s key propositions was that the act of translation
involves a mysterious intermediate step that she termed deverbalization
(<em>déverbalisation</em>). This step occurred between the initial
comprehension of the meaning of the source text and the re-expression of
that meaning in the target language. Seleskovitch explains the step
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>les formes linguistiques de l&rsquo;original s&rsquo;évanouissent pour ne
laisser subsister que la conscience du sens. &hellip; l&rsquo;on n&rsquo;utilise pas les
langues de la même manière pour désigner des notions et pour formuler
des idées</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;the linguistic forms of the original disappear, leaving
behind only an awareness of the meaning&hellip;. languages are not used in
the same manner to designate notions and to formulate ideas&rdquo;; Seleskovitch 2014/1976: 106, 108)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, one encounters the notion of deverbalization to this day in the hallways and
classrooms of ESIT, with students and lecturers regularly invoking it in
discussions of their practice. Yet, even as they invoke it, they
acknowledge quite uniformly that the concept remains rather mysterious.</p>
<p>This article takes up this mysterious concept and attempts to shed
historical and theoretical light on it. We begin with a sketch of the
theory itself&mdash;its origins in the 1960s, its subsequent elaborations
through interdisciplinary collaboration and the attempts at extending
it, towards addressing new questions. As we shall see, on the one hand,
the interpretive theorists' methodological stance, rooted in experience
as it is, yielded important insights into the study of translation, and
language more broadly. On the other hand, the various historical choices
made by these theorists, at least partly related to their methodological
stance, have created some fundamental problems for the theory. The
interpretive theory is, for instance, ultimately unable to theorize its
compelling concept of deverbalization. It is also unable to theorize
other practical questions such as that of translating style.</p>
<p>Having sketched the above critical history of the interpretive theory of
translation, the article will conclude with a suggestion regarding how
the theory may be developed along a fresh pathway that is in keeping
with its foundational methodology of beginning with experience. The aim
of the suggestion is to verbalize deverbalization as it were, to
conceptualize it with rigor. To this end, we shall draw on the
theorization of linguist Roman Jakobson, for Jakobson&rsquo;s starting point,
which lies in his critique of Saussure&rsquo;s model of <em>langue</em>, bears a
family resemblance to the interpretive theory&rsquo;s own point of departure.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="an-outline-of-the-interpretive-theory-of-translation">An outline of the interpretive theory of translation</h3>
<p>Acts of translation and interpretation must, of course, be located
squarely in the domain of experience, of language-in-use as I shall term
it here. This is the domain of what the interpretive theorists term
<em>parole</em> or discourse, using both terms interchangeably (cf. for example
Lederer 2014: 11)<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. The problem that Seleskovitch
confronted in the 1960s was that the dominant linguistic theories of the
time focused almost exclusively on systemic notions of language, utterly
disregarding language-in-use (Seleskovitch &amp; Lederer 1989:
243 ff.). Marianne Lederer, her chief collaborator,
references in an impressionistic fashion the prevailing &ldquo;<em>toute
puissance de la linguistique structurale</em>&rdquo; of the 1960s (the
&ldquo;omnipotence of structural linguistics&rdquo;; Lederer 2005: 3).
Seleskovitch herself mentions in passing the structuralist theories of
Saussure, Bloomfield and Chomsky (Seleskovitch 2014/1976:
128-129).</p>
<p>Noteworthy is the fact that the interpretive theory&rsquo;s point of departure
from those dominant structuralist theories is never specified beyond
these vague, impressionistic evocations: the interpretive theorists
never pick a specific theorist whose model they part from in
specifically delineated ways. Thus, although they speak of <em>langue</em>,
they neither adduce nor propose any theorization of it<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Working thus, Seleskovitch proposed a model of the acts of translation
and interpretation in three stages: comprehension, deverbalization and
re-expression (<em>compréhension</em>, <em>déverbalisation</em>, <em>réexpression</em>; cf.
for instance Seleskovitch 2014/1979: 118; Seleskovitch &amp;
Lederer 1989: 38). The first stage is that of the
comprehension by the translator of the meaning (<em>sens</em>) of the source
text within its context. The second stage is that of deverbalization,
during which the translator frees herself from the linguistic forms of
that meaning comprehended: these forms disappear, leaving behind solely
the &ldquo;deverbalized meaning&rdquo; (<em>le sens déverbalisé</em>). The third stage is
that of re-expression, wherein the translator re-expresses the
deverbalized meaning in the target language.</p>
<p>The three-stage model is pervaded by a distinct individualism: the
experience of comprehension and re-expression, and <em>a fortiori</em> that of
deverbalization, pertain to the analytical level of the individual, the
individual who encounters the text&mdash;whether oral of written&mdash;within
its context<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I shall refer to the theory as the &ldquo;interpretive theory&rdquo; for
short, avoiding the rather unappealing acronym &ldquo;ITT&rdquo; proposed in the
<em>Handbook of Translation Studies</em> (Lederer 2010: 173).
I shall accordingly refer to the proponents of this theory as
&ldquo;interpretive theorists.&rdquo; In French, of course, the theory goes by
the names &ldquo;<em>théorie interprétative du sens</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;interpretive theory
of meaning&rdquo;), &ldquo;<em>théorie interprétative</em>&rdquo; (interpretive theory) and
&ldquo;<em>théorie du sens</em>&rdquo; (theory of meaning or sense; cf. for example
Herbulot 2004).&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Note that the interpretive theorists, writing in French, use the
word <em>langue</em> in two ways: on the one hand, they use <em>langue</em> to
refer to a specific language pertaining to a collectivity, such as
English, French. On the other hand, they use <em>langue</em> to refer to an
autonomous, abstract system. For example, they speak of the
opposition between &ldquo;<em>langue et discours</em>&rdquo; (&quot;<em>langue</em> and
discourse&quot;): &ldquo;<em>Le discours est individu, la langue est espèce</em>&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Discourse is individual; language is collective&rdquo;). They critique
translations &ldquo;<em>en langue</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;in <em>langue</em>&quot;) as also &ldquo;<em>théories de la
traduction qui se situent au seul plan de la langue</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;theories of
translation that locate themselves exclusively on the level of
<em>langue</em>&quot;; Lederer 1976: 1; Lederer 2005: 36, 43; Seleskovitch 2014/1976: 115-116;

<p>This remains true even if several translators work together: the
