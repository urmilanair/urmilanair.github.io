<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Deverbalization is a mysterious&mdash;one might even say liminal&mdash;stage that translation theorists have argued occurs during translation. It was the interpreter and translator Danica Seleskovitch who presented the most compelling discussion of this idea, arguing that deverbalization (Fr. <em>déverbalization</em>) is an intermediate stage of any act of translation. During deverbalization, she asserted, the meaning of the source text that the translator has comprehended is stripped of its linguistic form; it is deverbalized before it may be re-expressed in the target language. Reflexive translators will no doubt attest to some such experience in their translation practice. I wrote this paper with a view to thinking through this mysterious notion&mdash;towards verbalizing deverbalization as it were.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>The interpretive theory of translation (<em>théorie interprétative du sens</em>) was founded at ESIT in Paris in the 1960s. Its point of departure lay in a critique of structural linguistics that dominated back then,
focusing on autonomous, systemic conceptions of language, to the
exclusion of language as used. Starting instead from experience, the
interpretive theorists proposed a three-stage model of translation and
interpretation, with a mysterious intermediate stage that they named
deverbalization, in which meaning (<em>sens</em>) was divested of linguistic
form. The paths taken and eschewed have shaped the theory&rsquo;s development,
and have resulted in a present-day impasse: the theory is unable to
conceptualize adequately its most compelling concept, that of
deverbalization. Tracing a critical history of the theory, this article
proposes a new path, towards theorizing deverbalization. Drawing on
Jakobsonian and semiotic critiques of autonomous, systemic language
models, the article aims to aid translators in their evaluation of
translational choices, by furnishing them with adequate conceptual tools
rooted in interpretive theoretical and semiotic traditions.</p>

<h3 id="a-critique-of-the-interpretive-theorys-conception-of-meaning-sens">A critique of the interpretive theory&rsquo;s conception of meaning (<em>sens</em>)</h3>
<p>The above delineation of the interpretive theory brings us back to our
question: how is meaning constituted in this theory? We have seen that
language operates on three levels to constitute meaning. We have also
noted that the theory neither adopts nor proposes a conceptualization of
<em>langue</em> although this systemic notion is integral to its model of
translation. Now, if we do not have a conceptualization of <em>langue</em>, we
have no way of knowing how the elements of <em>langue</em> (linguistic
signification and form, the linguistic sign in brief) might work within
the level on which they subsist, namely language-as-system. If we do not
know how the elements of <em>langue</em> work within it, we cannot know how
they work outside it, that is, on the two levels of language-in-use,
namely those of individual experience and the group. The interpretive
theory can, therefore, give us no answers regarding the precise role of
linguistic signification in the constitution of meaning<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. We will see
shortly the consequences of this state of affairs.</p>
<h3 id="elaborations-of-the-interpretive-theory-paths-taken-paths-eschewed">Elaborations of the interpretive theory: paths taken, paths eschewed</h3>
<p>The interpretive theorists over the years took certain paths and
eschewed others in developing their theory.</p>
<p>One path taken was that of collaboration with the experimental human
sciences. Lederer discusses the dialogues, dating back to the 1960s,
that Seleskovitch initiated with experimental psychologists,
psycholinguists, neuropsychologists, the ideas of psychologist Jean
Piaget and neuropsychologist Jacques Barbizet proving the most fruitful
(Lederer 2005: 10-17). Seleskovitch and Lederer, both interpreters in
the first instance, no doubt had a certain predilection for this
direction and worked to facilitate the experimental study of memory and
interferences, of simultaneous interpretation, of comparative studies of
interpretation between specific language pairs, bilingualism, to name
but a few (cf. Lederer 1981; Seleskovitch 2014/1980, 2014/1981;
Seleskovitch &amp; Lederer 1989: 254 ff.).</p>
<p>As per Seleskovitch, this pathway proved fruitful in relation to her
seminal notion of deverbalization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>En démontrant et en expliquant les mécanismes de la mémoire, J. Barbizet</em> [&hellip;], <em>de son côté, donnait consistance à mon postulat de l&rsquo;existence d&rsquo;une pensée non verbale indépendante, sinon de l&rsquo;acquisition de la langue, en tout cas de son emploi.</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;In demonstrating and explaining the mechanisms of memory, Barbizet &hellip; has substantiated my assumption of the existence of non-verbal thought that is independent, if not of language acquisition, at least of language use&rdquo;; Seleskovitch 2014/1976: 89.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barbizet&rsquo;s studies of memory served to substantiate the notion of
deverbalization through neurophysiological research of linguistic and
non-linguistic knowledge (Seleskovitch &amp; Lederer 1989: 257-258).</p>
<p>An experimental backing of the notion of deverbalization does not, of
course, constitute a theoretical backing to the concept: deverbalization
is the stripping away of linguistic form (an element of <em>langue</em>, thus
inaccessible to experiment) from a meaning subsisting in an individually
experienced instance of language-in-use that is understood because it is
shared at the group level. Consequently, without a conception of
<em>langue</em> or of how its elements might operate within and outside the
systemic level, we cannot say anything <em>theoretically</em> relevant about
deverbalization.</p>
<p>This brings us to the road not taken by interpretive theory, namely the
pathway of collaboration with theoreticians of language&mdash;within
poststructuralist linguistics, anthropology, linguistic anthropology and
philosophy, to name but a few disciplines that could well have aided the
interpretive theory, as we shall see shortly. We see the problems posed
by untheorized <em>langue</em> come to the fore in the attempts of
second-generation interpretive theorist and literary translator
Fortunato Israël who, beginning in the 1990s, sought to extend the
theory, towards addressing the question of translating style.</p>
<p>Style is discussed in the interpretive theory as the exploitation of
linguistic forms (&quot;<em>l&rsquo;exploitation des formes</em>&quot; <em>linguistiques</em>; Lederer
2005: 25). Israël notes that, in literary texts, linguistic form is
crucial to the constitution of meaning, creating specific effects upon
the reader. Consider the following passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>même en littérature ou dans d&rsquo;autres cas où la forme est primordiale, la langue reste un moyen, le vecteur de la pensée ou de l&rsquo;effet, et non une fin en soi. Il importe [&hellip;] de bien faire la distinction entre la matérialité de la forme et sa fonction : seules les valeurs notionnelles ou émotionnelles dont elle est porteuse sont à préserver et non la forme elle-même, ou ce que dit la langue ou ce qui se rattache au fonctionnement normal du système. En d&rsquo;autres termes, au moment de traduire, une distinction s&rsquo;impose entre d&rsquo;une part le systémique et de l&rsquo;autre l&rsquo;intentionnel lié à l&rsquo;acte de parole.</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;even in literature or in other cases where form is crucial, <em>langue</em> remains a means, the vector of thought or of an effect, and not an end in itself. It is important &hellip; to distinguish between the materiality of form and its function: only the emotional or notional values that form bears are to be preserved, not the form itself or that which <em>langue</em> specifies or which is attached to the normal functioning of the system. In other words, at the moment of translating, a distinction imposes itself between, on the one hand, the systemic and, on the other, the intentional linked with the speech act (<em>l&rsquo;acte de parole</em>)&quot;; Israël 1994: 109; cf. also Israël 1990: 36-39.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the absence of a conception of <em>langue</em> and of how its elements
operate on non-systemic levels, and read as generously as possible,
Israël can at best be seen as repeating the formulations already
proposed by the first generation of interpretive theorists: <em>langue</em>, he
asserts, is a means (referencing here, one presumes, the system-level);
it is the vector of thought (shared, susceptible of institutionalization
at group-level); and it is a vector of effects (on readers, the level of
individual experience). He thus recapitulates the three analytical
levels conceptualized by Seleskovitch, unable to say anything
theoretically relevant about how linguistic form might &ldquo;function&rdquo; at the
level of individual experience. The absence of answers to this question
entails that the interpretive theory cannot aid translators as they try
to evaluate their own translational choices in matters of style (Nair
2021: 61-68).</p>
<p>Furthermore, with regard to deverbalization, Israël writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>La déverbalisation</em> [&hellip;] <em>ne se limite pas à dissocier le message de son vecteur mais consiste aussi à dégager du matériau sonore toutes les valeurs sur lesquelles se fonde la physionomie de l&rsquo;ouvrage.</em> (&ldquo;Deverbalization &hellip; is not limited to dissociating the message from its vector but consists also in extracting from the sonic material all the values on which are founded the physiognomy of the literary work&rdquo;; Israël 1990: 41.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His statement here is far from incorrect. The only trouble is that, in
the absence of a theorization of <em>langue</em>, it has no conceptual backing.</p>

<p>Note that Saussure, for example, is not obliged to give us such an

object of linguistics (cf. for instance Saussure 1971:
