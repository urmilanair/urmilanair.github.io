<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Deverbalization is a mysterious&mdash;one might even say liminal&mdash;stage that translation theorists have argued occurs during translation. It was the interpreter and translator Danica Seleskovitch who presented the most compelling discussion of this idea, arguing that deverbalization (Fr. <em>déverbalization</em>) is an intermediate stage of any act of translation. During deverbalization, she asserted, the meaning of the source text that the translator has comprehended is stripped of its linguistic form; it is deverbalized before it may be re-expressed in the target language. Reflexive translators will no doubt attest to some such experience in their translation practice. I wrote this paper with a view to thinking through this mysterious notion&mdash;towards verbalizing deverbalization as it were.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>The interpretive theory of translation (<em>théorie interprétative du sens</em>) was founded at ESIT in Paris in the 1960s. Its point of departure lay in a critique of structural linguistics that dominated back then,
focusing on autonomous, systemic conceptions of language, to the
exclusion of language as used. Starting instead from experience, the
interpretive theorists proposed a three-stage model of translation and
interpretation, with a mysterious intermediate stage that they named
deverbalization, in which meaning (<em>sens</em>) was divested of linguistic
form. The paths taken and eschewed have shaped the theory&rsquo;s development,
and have resulted in a present-day impasse: the theory is unable to
conceptualize adequately its most compelling concept, that of
deverbalization. Tracing a critical history of the theory, this article
proposes a new path, towards theorizing deverbalization. Drawing on
Jakobsonian and semiotic critiques of autonomous, systemic language
models, the article aims to aid translators in their evaluation of
translational choices, by furnishing them with adequate conceptual tools
rooted in interpretive theoretical and semiotic traditions.</p>

<h3 id="a-way-out-of-the-impasse">A way out of the impasse</h3>
<p>How might the interpretive theory of translation get out of this
impasse? Let us consider the work of linguist Roman Jakobson whose
theorization is much cited by the interpretive theorists, though
unfortunately in a piecemeal fashion and, consequently, to no avail (cf.
for example Israël 1994: 108, 1990: 38 ff.). We begin with
Seleskovitch&rsquo;s critique of Jakobson in her seminal essay cited at the
outset of this article. Seleskovitch chooses to class Jakobson with the
rest of the structuralist linguists, dismissing him as one of those
theorists who &ldquo;focus exclusively on the level of <em>langue</em>&rdquo; (&quot;<em>qui se
situent au seul plan de la langue</em>&quot;), who never consider a &ldquo;real
situation&rdquo; (&quot;<em>une situation réelle</em>&quot;) within which a sentence might
derive its meaning (Seleskovitch 2014/1976: 116-118). Let
us consider what Jakobson writes before discussing Seleskovitch&rsquo;s
reading of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If some grammatical category is absent in a given language, its meaning may be translated into this language by lexical means&hellip;. It is more difficult to remain faithful to the original when we translate into a language provided with a certain grammatical category from a language devoid of such a category&hellip;. As Boas neatly observed, the grammatical pattern of a language (as opposed to its lexical stock) determines those aspects of each experience that must be expressed in the given language &hellip; In order to translate accurately the English sentence &ldquo;I hired a worker,&rdquo; a Russian needs supplementary information &hellip; because he must make his choice between a verb of completive or noncompletive aspect &hellip; and between a masculine and feminine noun &hellip; Because the information required by the English and Russian grammatical pattern is unlike, we face quite different sets of two-choice situations&rdquo; (Jakobson 2012: 129).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seleskovitch cites the above passage and argues that the &ldquo;real
situation&rdquo; of an utterance like &ldquo;I hired a worker&rdquo; (she cites the
sentence in English) would indicate to the Russian translator the gender
of the worker to be used in the translation despite the absence of that
information in the English. While this is not incorrect, her reading
misses Jakobson&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>In fact, what Jakobson gestures towards here is precisely a means of
theorizing a fundamental aspect of the stage of deverbalization. He does
not conceptualize this stage as such, and he does not discuss
&ldquo;interlingual translation&rdquo; as being anything other than a two-stage
process&mdash;which would have been grounds for an interesting critique of
his essay by Seleskovitch, though unfortunately she does not pursue that
thread.</p>
<p>The passage cited above from Jakobson&rsquo;s essay on translation in fact
offers an explanation of one of the reasons why any reflexive
translator, while translating, would have noticed an intermediate stage
that could be named &ldquo;deverbalization&rdquo;: different languages express and
parse the world differently, for instance via different &ldquo;grammatical
patterns&rdquo;. Jakobson gestures here towards his own theory of language,
the starting point of which is a critique of the Saussurean dichotomy of
<em>langue</em> versus <em>parole</em>, a critique that bears a family resemblance to
Seleskovitch&rsquo;s own critique of dominant structuralist linguistic
theories of the 1960s<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In what follows, we shall visit Jakobson&rsquo;s theorization of language. Our
aim is to think through the interpretive theory&rsquo;s concept of
deverbalization.</p>
<h3 id="jakobson-on-language">Jakobson on language</h3>
<p>One of Jakobson&rsquo;s fundamental critiques of Saussure begins with the
observation of shifters. Shifters &ldquo;are distinguished from all other
constituents of the linguistic code solely by their compulsory reference
to the given message&rdquo; (Jakobson 1971: 132;
Caton 1987: 225ff.). For instance, the pronoun &ldquo;I&rdquo; indexes
the person uttering it but is simultaneously a linguistic sign. In the
face of shifters, the Saussurean <em>langue-parole</em> dichotomy begins to
crumble (cf. also Benveniste 1966). In fact, Jakobson
points out, this property&mdash;of simultaneously belonging to a language
code and being indelibly dependent on the context of the latter&rsquo;s
use&mdash;is quite prevalent. It is to be found on all levels of language,
from the phonic to the semantic to the grammatical. Language, for
Jakobson, is therefore best studied not in terms of Saussurean
autonomous <em>langue</em>, but rather as context-dependent signs involved in
chains of semiosis, following the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce.</p>
<p>Rather than the dichotomy of <em>langue</em> and <em>parole</em>, Jakobson configures
the linguistic sign within <em>code</em> and <em>message</em>. He speaks of language
as having a &ldquo;bipolar structure,&rdquo; organized along <em>virtual</em> and <em>actual</em>
or <em>realized</em> axes (1987/1956: 111)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>At the heart of Jakobson&rsquo;s conception of language is his model of the
speech event in which a <em>message</em> is communicated by an <em>addresser</em> to
an <em>addressee</em>, the two being somehow in <em>contact</em>, within a specific
<em>context</em>, using a shared <em>code</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Such a speech event involves six
factors: addresser, addressee, message, context, contact, code. Each
factor &ldquo;determines a different function of language&rdquo; (Jakobson
1987/1960: 66-71). Every verbal message involves all six of
these functions, though one or more may predominate. While we shall not
detail the six functions, one of them may be cited for illustrative
purposes: consider a speech event aimed at communicating a certain piece
of information. In Jakobsonian terms, the set (<em>Einstellung</em>)<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of
this verbal communication is towards the <em>context</em> or referent. The
dominant function involved is therefore the <em>referential</em> or
<em>denotative</em> or <em>cognitive</em> <em>function</em>, which shapes the message in
light of this focus. Of course, other functions could play secondary
roles therein as well. For instance, the emotive or expressive function
of language, with its set towards the addresser, could also play a role,
nuancing the information with the addresser&rsquo;s feelings about the
subject.</p>
<p>Consider the factor that Jakobson terms <em>code</em> within the speech event.
Code here &ldquo;represents a system of interconnected subcodes&rdquo; which are
experienced by speakers as &ldquo;a unity of language&rdquo; (Jakobson 1987/1960:
65) <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The linguistic signs that make up language codes subsist along two axes.
First, the linguistic sign subsists <em>virtually</em> in a code. At the moment
of a speech event, the sign must be <em>selected</em> from this virtual set.
Other terms that describe this <em>axis of selection</em> are: <em>equivalence</em>,
<em>similarity</em>, <em>substitution</em>, <em>alternation</em>, <em>metaphor</em>. For the
linguistic sign is selected based on its equivalence or similarity to
the other signs of that virtual set; it can substitute for or alternate
with them, and stands in a relation of metaphor to them. The second axis
along which the linguistic sign subsists is the <em>axis of combination</em>:
the linguistic sign selected from that virtual set is <em>actualized</em> in
the message. Other terms that describe this axis are: <em>contexture</em>,
<em>contiguity</em>, <em>alignment</em>, <em>metonymy</em>. For the linguistic sign selected
is combined contiguously with the other signs of the message; it is
aligned with them within the context of the message; and it stands in a
relation of metonymy with respect to the other signs of the message.
These two modes of arrangement obtain at all levels of
language&mdash;phonetic, semantic and grammatical. This is language&rsquo;s
bipolar structure.</p>
<p>For example, an invocation of &ldquo;<em>un papillon bleu</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;a blue butterfly&rdquo;)
could be a sign within a message between two legionnaires, functioning
referentially or cognitively to mean &ldquo;<em>une caisse de bière</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;a case of
beer&rdquo;) within their shared subcode (Seleskovitch
2014/1979: 348). This meaning would not obtain within the
wider French language code but could be easily explained to French
non-legionnaires using other equivalent linguistic signs. Additionally,
&ldquo;<em>un papillon bleu</em>&rdquo; used thus would semiotically index the addresser
and addressee&rsquo;s sharedness of that subcode and membership within the
Foreign Legion in French Guiana.</p>
<p>By virtue of these two modes of arrangement, the linguistic sign is
involved in two sets of semiotic relations within a message (Jakobson
1987/1956: 98-100, 104-106). One relation is between the
linguistic sign and the code to which it belongs. This is an internal
relation. As was mentioned, it is virtual and based on equivalence, the
sign being selected from a virtual set containing signs that are
similar, whether phonically (pig, fig) or semantically (kid, child,
infant; or money, a case of beer, blue butterfly) or grammatically
(parallel grammatical categories used in poetry). The second relation is
an external one, between the linguistic sign and the context of the
message. This is the relationship of actual contiguity between the signs
selected, which combine to form the message within its context of the
speech event.</p>
<p>Crucial to Jakobson&rsquo;s conception is the semiotic nature of the
linguistic sign, in the Peircean sense. The linguistic sign is involved
in chains of semiosis at all linguistic levels, from the phonemic to the
textual<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. A simple example is the sentence &ldquo;the President and the
Secretary of State attended the meeting,&rdquo; in which the two are always
mentioned in this order. The reason is that the relative positions of
the two noun phrases function as a sign, indexing an extra-linguistic
social hierarchy (Jakobson 1987/1956: 98-100, 104-106; 1987/1966: 418-421).</p>
<p>This schema of Jakobson&rsquo;s conceptualization of language suffices for our
purposes here. It serves to indicate that Jakobson moved away from a
<em>langue-parole</em> distinction and developed a rigorous, experience- and
observation-based theorization of language in all its &ldquo;bipolar&rdquo; and
semiotic complexity.</p>

<p>Note once more that the intuitions and basic positions of the
interpretive theorists are typically sound and are often very
similar to those of Jakobson. Recall, for instance, that
Seleskovitch writes: &ldquo;<em>l&rsquo;on n&rsquo;utilise pas les langues de la même
manière pour désigner des notions et pour formuler des idées</em>&rdquo;
(&ldquo;languages are not used in the same manner to designate notions and
to formulate ideas&rdquo;; Seleskovitch 2014/1976: 108). The
problem with the interpretive theory is that it does not give us a
theoretical account of several key concepts that it mobilizes:
<em>langue</em>, its elements and, consequently, deverbalization.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This virtual-actual dichotomy that Jakobson proposes is, in fact,
rooted in Saussure, that is, in Jakobson&rsquo;s brilliant critical
reading of him (Jakobson 1990/1942: 89-91).&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Note that although Jakobson speaks of the &ldquo;speech event,&rdquo; his
model applies equally to spoken and written texts.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Jakobson, in using the German word &ldquo;<em>Einstellung</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;set&rdquo;), was
apparently thinking of old-fashioned radios that may be tuned or
&ldquo;set&rdquo; to a specific channel (Silverstein, pers. comm. 2003).&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:5" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Note that &ldquo;language&rdquo; has a broad, non-technical sense here. It
invokes primarily the experience of the &ldquo;unity of language&rdquo; of a
speaker of any speech community (Jakobson 1987/1960:
65). There are language ideologies and limits to the
awareness of speakers that are involved in creating and asserting
this unity of language (Silverstein 2001).&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Jakobson&rsquo;s theorization of verbal communication was extended by
Michael Silverstein and his students and collaborators, particularly
within the discipline of linguistic anthropology, towards
conceptualizing language in discursive interaction and culture more
broadly. (Cf. Jakobson 1987/1956, 1987/1960, Jakobson et
al 1990, Silverstein 1987, 1997, 2004; cf. also Caton 1987, Lee 1997,

theorization.)&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
