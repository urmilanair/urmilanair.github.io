<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Deverbalization is a mysterious&mdash;one might even say liminal&mdash;stage that translation theorists have argued occurs during translation. It was the interpreter and translator Danica Seleskovitch who presented the most compelling discussion of this idea, arguing that deverbalization (Fr. <em>déverbalization</em>) is an intermediate stage of any act of translation. During deverbalization, she asserted, the meaning of the source text that the translator has comprehended is stripped of its linguistic form; it is deverbalized before it may be re-expressed in the target language. Reflexive translators will no doubt attest to some such experience in their translation practice. I wrote this paper with a view to thinking through this mysterious notion&mdash;towards verbalizing deverbalization as it were.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>The interpretive theory of translation (<em>théorie interprétative du sens</em>) was founded at ESIT in Paris in the 1960s. Its point of departure lay in a critique of structural linguistics that dominated back then,
focusing on autonomous, systemic conceptions of language, to the
exclusion of language as used. Starting instead from experience, the
interpretive theorists proposed a three-stage model of translation and
interpretation, with a mysterious intermediate stage that they named
deverbalization, in which meaning (<em>sens</em>) was divested of linguistic
form. The paths taken and eschewed have shaped the theory&rsquo;s development,
and have resulted in a present-day impasse: the theory is unable to
conceptualize adequately its most compelling concept, that of
deverbalization. Tracing a critical history of the theory, this article
proposes a new path, towards theorizing deverbalization. Drawing on
Jakobsonian and semiotic critiques of autonomous, systemic language
models, the article aims to aid translators in their evaluation of
translational choices, by furnishing them with adequate conceptual tools
rooted in interpretive theoretical and semiotic traditions.</p>

<h3 id="verbalizing-deverbalization">Verbalizing Deverbalization</h3>
<p>How may we mobilize Jakobson&rsquo;s conceptions towards verbalizing, as it
were, deverbalization? To recapitulate, Seleskovitch conceptualized
deverbalization as a moment of &ldquo;<em>pensée non verbale</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;non-verbal
thought&rdquo;; Seleskovitch 2014/1976: 89). In this stage, the meaning of the
source text, comprehended during the first, comprehension stage of
translation, subsists as &ldquo;deverbalized meaning&rdquo; (<em>sens déverbalisé</em>).</p>
<p>Now, crucially, Jakobson holds that it is not merely languages that
possess a bipolar structure but <em>all semiotic systems</em>. He writes of the
virtual-actual dichotomy that it &ldquo;appears to be of primal significance
and consequence for all verbal behavior and for human behavior in
general&rdquo; (Jakobson 1987/1956: 112)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Drawing on this conception, we
posit the following: during deverbalization, the translator reflects on
<em>a bipolar structure of equivalences across two sets of codes</em>, with a
view to selecting from amongst those equivalences. The equivalences
across the two codes pertain to all levels of language, including
extra-linguistic sociocultural realities that are encoded in
language<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The equivalences are established in and by the conventions
of second language acquisition as well as institutional forms (lexicons,
grammar texts), and are manifest in the linguistic competence and
knowledge, and the cognitive baggage of the translator.</p>
<p>Let us consider the example of a French to English translation of the
legionnaires' &ldquo;<em>un papillon bleu</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;a blue butterfly&rdquo;), cited earlier,
towards clarifying this position<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Consider first the stages of comprehension and re-expression. The
translator begins by comprehending that &ldquo;<em>un papillon bleu</em>&rdquo; means a sum
of money, specifically, the price of a case of beer. Terms belonging to
other subcodes and to the French language code more broadly, subsisting
virtually alongside &ldquo;<em>papillon bleu</em>&rdquo; on the axis of selection, include:
<em>pognon, fric, oseille, argent, monnaie</em>, etc.</p>
<p>The re-expression of &ldquo;<em>un papillon bleu</em>&rdquo; in English would depend on the
context of the translation. The virtual set of equivalent terms would
include: <em>money, cash, funds, buck, pony, dough, bacon</em>. In the
subtitles of a movie about legionnaires, perhaps involving a visual of
the blue butterfly, the translator may forego the imagery and
sociocultural specificities of the sign and its subcode, translating it
simply as &ldquo;<em>cash</em>,&rdquo; for rapid comprehension by the viewer. In case of an
academic translation, the translator could offer a literal translation
of the equivalence with an explanatory gloss&mdash;as has been done in this
article for example. In a novel, absent any reference to Lepidoptera,
the translator might choose to preserve the logic of evaluating animal
species in terms of alcohol, and use &ldquo;<em>bucks</em>,&rdquo; since folk tradition has
it that in the 18^th^ century in the United States, five
bucks&mdash;referring to their skins&mdash;were worth a cask of whiskey (Kenton
2020). Alternatively, if the translation was for a British audience, and
the aim was to preserve a sense of the amount of money involved, she
might select &ldquo;<em>pony</em>,&rdquo; British slang for £25 (Haigh 2018). The specific
term selected would thus depend on the verbal communication within which
the translation was to occur.</p>
<p>Consider now an example of the equivalences across linguistic and
cultural codes and subcodes on which the translator reflects during
deverbalization. As mentioned, these equivalences pertain to all the
levels of the codes involved, from the phonetic to the semantic, the
grammatical and the textual. We will consider the phonetic level here
for illustrative purposes. Imagine that the French phrase to be
translated is a legionnaire&rsquo;s words &ldquo;<em>Un papillon bleu pour une caisse
de bière!</em>&rdquo; and that the original French was included in a text that
had some poetic value. The English translation would accordingly have to
appeal poetically to the English reader. The translator during
deverbalization would therefore have to consider various possible sound
shapes. At the level of the individual words she has the following
equivalence sets across the two codes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>bleu</em> (adjective) == <em>blue, azure</em>, <em>turquoise, cerulean</em>, etc. (adjectives)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>papillon</em> (noun, masculine) == <em>butterfly, Lepidoptera, winged-creature, insect</em>, etc. (nouns)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She would consider the various permutations of these two and their sound
shapes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>papillon bleu</em> == <em>blue butterfly, azure insect, cerulean winged-creature, cerulean creature</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She would play with the various possibilities, arriving at the following
phrase-level set of similar signs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Un papillon bleu pour une caisse de bière !</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>==</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Blue butterflies buy beer!</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The cerulean creature&mdash;my case of beer!</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now &ldquo;<em>Blue butterflies buy beer!</em>&rdquo; with its alliteration may sound
amusing. By contrast, &ldquo;<em>The cerulean creature&ndash;my case of beer!</em>&rdquo;
produces a phonetic and cultural-conceptual dissonance between the
ethereal-sounding &ldquo;<em>cerulean</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>beer</em>,&rdquo; the latter associated with down-to-earth folk in American and British culture. This
dissonance could make the utterer&mdash;the legionnaire in translation&mdash;cut
a ridiculous figure. The possibilities of such effects would be known to
the translator through her cognitive baggage. During deverbalization,
she would evaluate these various effects, reflecting on the various
equivalences across the two codes. She would assess each such
permutation across the two codes, for comparability of reference and of
effect on the reader. At the end of deverbalization, she would select
what she considers to be the best equivalence across the two codes,
depending on the context, thereby arriving at a specific combination of
linguistic signs to be actualized in re-expression.</p>
<p>The process discussed above with regard to the phonetic plane applies
equally in case of equivalences at the levels of grammar and cultural
concepts that are encoded in language. For instance, consider the
example of &ldquo;I hired a worker&rdquo; and the Russian translator&rsquo;s problem of
specifying the noun&rsquo;s grammatical gender. From a Jakobsonian
perspective, during deverbalization, the translator would draw on her
cognitive baggage to reflect on equivalences at the level cultural
concepts: along the axis of selection would be certain types of workers
culturally construed as being feminine in anglophone and Russian
cultures (nurses, nannies) and others construed as masculine (plumbers,
mechanics). The translator would reflect on these cultural equivalences
and select the grammatical gender accordingly, for use in the axis of
combination actualized in the translation.</p>
<p>These then are examples of the bipolar structure of equivalences across
language and cultural codes on which the translator reflects during the
stage of deverbalization. A discussion of these structures has given us
a way to verbalize deverbalization, to conceptualize it, with a view to
exploring it further, and to answering questions that the interpretive
theory could not address for lack of a theorization of <em>langue</em>. Thus it
is that, via the stage of deverbalization, the translator wends her way
out of the axes of selection and combination of the source text&rsquo;s code
and subcodes, and gradually immerses herself in those of the target
language<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. She does this by reflecting on the bipolar structure of
equivalences across the two sets of codes and subcodes.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This article has thus offered a critical history of the interpretive
theory of translation, a theory founded by interpreter and translator,
Danica Seleskovitch, and extended by her collaborators and students at
ESIT in Paris and beyond. We traced the origins of the theory in the
1960s when, confronted by the predominant disdain for the study of
language in use, Seleskovitch chose to begin with experience. She
posited the mysterious stage of deverbalization as occurring betwixt and
between the comprehension of a source text and its re-expression in a
target language. Unfortunately, the historical foundations of the
theory, and the specific paths taken and eschewed in its subsequent
elaboration, entailed that deverbalization could not be adequately
conceptualized. The interpretive theory suffers from the inadequate
theorization of its concept of <em>langue</em>. For <em>langue</em>, in the form given
it by structuralist linguistics, does not present itself as such to
individual experience. The interpretive theorists, insisting as they did
on the experiential basis of their theory, were therefore unable to
account adequately for <em>langue</em> even though it lay at the heart of their
three-stage model of translation.</p>
<p>Having sketched out this critical history of the interpretive theory, we
then visited the theorization of Jakobson, rooted in a critique of
Saussurean structuralism, a critique that bears a family resemblance to
the starting point of the interpretive theorists. We drew on Jakobson&rsquo;s
conception of the &ldquo;bipolar structure&rdquo; of language and, indeed, all
semiosis, to verbalize, as it were, deverbalization. Deverbalization, we
argued, may be understood as a moment in which the translator, betwixt
and between two codes, reflects on equivalences across those codes on
all semiotic levels, from phonetic to semantic and grammatical to
cultural: the translator reflects on potential equivalences and then
selects from among them, towards actualizing a translation.</p>
<p>There remains, of course, much work to be done towards fleshing out
deverbalization: each of the linguistic and semiotic levels mentioned
above merits a thorough exploration. Next, a rigorous analysis of
deverbalization in Peircean terms would no doubt yield fresh insights
into the nature of translation. Furthermore, there is the fact that the
act of translation in practice involves numerous iterations of the
three-stage model, and this applies across the board to all types of
translation (cf. for instance Williamson 2021 on an ideal of financial
translation practice). A study of the three-stage model in such an
iterative process represents another way forward into a well-founded,
conceptually backed verbalization of deverbalization.</p>

<p>Jakobson owes this stance or insight (depending on whether you
view his conceptualization as conjecture or discovery) at least in
part to Peirce, for whom &ldquo;the collective total of all that is in any
way or in any sense present to the mind&rdquo; is semiotic: for Peirce,
there is no such thing as &ldquo;naked thought itself,&rdquo; divested of signs
(Peirce 1960: 141; Parmentier 1994: 43).&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>To clarify: Seleskovitch calls this stage &ldquo;deverbalization&rdquo;
referring to the fact that the meaning (<em>sens</em>) to be translated has
no linguistic form during this stage. This is true here since the
equivalences across codes are <em>metalinguistic</em> (involving the
translator&rsquo;s <em>reflection on</em> two languages and their equivalences)
and <em>metapragmatic</em> (involving the translator&rsquo;s <em>reflection on</em>
extra-linguistic equivalences across cultural codes), to invoke
Silverstein 1993.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Deverbalization, from the Jakobsonian perspective, may be
conceived as a moment within the myriad Peircean chains of
non-linguistic semioses (potentially infinite in number, but
typically limited by the context, uptake of the source text by the
translator and the <em>skopos</em> of the translation among other things).
These chains link the English source text and the French target
translation within some speech event. While a discussion of the
semiotic aspects of deverbalization would enable a fuller
conceptualization of this stage, it lies beyond the scope of this
article. (On the chain of semiosis, cf. for instance Peirce 1960:
171 (paragraph 339); for exegeses on this notion, cf. Parmentier
1994: esp. 7, 10-11, 24-25; also Masquelier 2021: 52; Silverstein
2003. On the notion of <em>skopos</em> in translation, cf. Reiß and
Vermeer/Nord and Dudenhöfer 2014: 86.)&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Note that Lederer named the divergence of such subcodes across two
languages the phenomenon of synecdoche (<em>synecdoque</em>): &ldquo;<em>en discours</em> [&hellip;] <em>divers locuteurs désignent les mêmes choses par des aspects différents</em> [&hellip;] <em>Chacun désigne dans sa langue une
idée identique par une synecdoque différente</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;in discourse &hellip; different speakers designate the same things by different aspects &hellip; Each designates in her own language an identical idea by means of a different synecdoche&rdquo;; Lederer 2005: 18). Of course, her term,
while intuitively relevant, suffers from the absence of a
theorization of <em>langue</em>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
