<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Never having learnt German, my acquaintance with Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s essay
on translation was initially through the Harry Zohn translation, a
translation that is often pretty but also what one might term
&lsquo;abstruse.&rsquo; It was only upon reading the Steven Rendall translation that
I was finally able to arrive at a coherent and satisfactory interpretation of
Benjamin&rsquo;s essay. For while the Rendall translation is on occasion less
pretty than the Zohn translation, Rendall does, nevertheless, give us a
Benjamin who is incisive and precise, unlike Zohn whose Benjamin is
often lost somewhere along the abstruse-obscure-obscurant cline.
Furthermore, Rendall&rsquo;s translation regularly accords with the wonderful French
translation by Maurice de Gandillac (proofread by Rainer Rochlitz). This
has led me to accept Rendall&rsquo;s as the definitive English translation.</p>
<p>I present here a <strong>critical reading, through a semiotic lens</strong>, of &ldquo;The
Translator&rsquo;s Task.&rdquo; Together with it, I present <strong>comparative notes</strong> on the three translations referenced. The notes focus on the
following three types of academic translation problems:</p>
<p>(a) problems arising in relation to the translation of key terms and
ideas;<br />
(b) the translation of complex chains of anaphoric reference, so
common in philosophical texts;<br />
(c) a reader&rsquo;s worst nightmare: two translations that diverge in
meaning &hellip;</p>
<p>I end with <strong>a set of rules of good practice for academic translation</strong>.
These rules are derived from the critical comparative notes and,
needless to say, my own academic translation practice.</p>
<br />
<h3 id="on-benjamin-on-translation-_in_-translation-part-ibr-a-reading-of-the-essay-through-a-semiotic-lens">On Benjamin On Translation <em>In</em> Translation, Part I:<br />A reading of the essay through a semiotic lens</h3>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Viewed through a semiotic lens, the thrust of Benjamin&rsquo;s conception of
translation may be summed up thus: translation is an indexical
icon of &ldquo;pure language.&rdquo; Note that Benjamin&rsquo;s focus here is specifically
on the translation of &ldquo;great literary works.&rdquo; (This significance of this focus will become clear in Part III.)</p>
<p>We begin with a consideration of Benjamin&rsquo;s model of language.</p>
<p>For the sake of convenience, I shall reference the three translations of
Benjamin&rsquo;s essay using only the name of the translator, followed by the
relevant page number.</p>
<h4 id="benjamins-model-of-language">Benjamin&rsquo;s model of language</h4>
<p>Benjamin speaks of the intentions of languages, &ldquo;what they want to say&rdquo;
(Rendall, 77). Within the intention of a language, he states, we must
distinguish the language&rsquo;s &ldquo;modes of meaning&rdquo; (Rendall, 78). These modes
of meaning must be considered at two analytical levels. The first level
is that of the particular elements of a language&mdash;&ldquo;words, sentences,
structures&rdquo; (Ibid.). At this level, the mode of meaning of one
language stands in <em>a relationship of mutual exclusion</em> to the modes of
meaning of other languages. Thus, the German <em>Brot</em> and the French
<em>pain</em> &ldquo;signify something different to a German or a Frenchman&rdquo;
(Ibid.).</p>
<p>We may understand this as follows: a word within a language may be
glossed to explain what it is and what it is not with respect to other
nearby terms in that language. The set of these nearby terms shapes the
native speaker&rsquo;s understanding of the term itself. By contrast, the
structure of correspondence between two words of different languages is
a very different matter, given the differences in the two sets of nearby terms.
For instance, the German need not be aware of this set of nearby terms
in French, which is why she would understand <em>Brot</em> in dependence on its
nearby terms in German and would, perhaps, understand <em>pain</em> as well,
effectively, as <em>Brot</em>. By contrast, a &ldquo;Frenchman&rdquo; would understand
<em>pain</em> in dependence on its nearby terms in French and would perhaps
understand <em>Brot</em>, effectively, as <em>pain</em>. In general, the native
language&rsquo;s set of nearby terms would influence the speaker&rsquo;s
understanding of the foreign language term. Thus, the German <em>Brot</em> and
the French <em>pain</em> would &ldquo;signify something different to a German or a
Frenchman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second level at which modes of meaning must be considered is that of
the language as a whole. At this level, the modes of meaning of one
language <em>complement</em> those of other languages: at the level of language
as a whole, considering the intended object &ldquo;taken absolutely&rdquo; (Rendall, 78), the modes of meaning involved in words such as <em>Brot</em> and <em>pain</em> complement each other since both &ldquo;&lsquo;intend&rsquo; the same object&rdquo;
(Zohn, 74).</p>
<p>Now, within any single, uncomplemented language (that is, considering the first analytical level), the
intended object remains forever hidden<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. One reason for this would be
that a language, for Benjamin, is in a constant state of transformation, so that the
intended object can never be independently present in any way therein
(Rendall, 78). This is why the revelation of the intended object
requires the complementary relationship of languages, the harmony of
their modes of meaning.</p>
<p>When and how will the intended object emerge, revealing itself in all
its glory? To understand this, we must consider the fundamental
postulate of Benjamin&rsquo;s model.</p>
<br />

<br />
<h3 id="comparative-critique-of-the-three-translationsbr-_considering-terms-in-translation_">Comparative Critique of the Three Translations:<br /><em>Considering terms in translation</em></h3>
<p>I present here two examples of types of problems one regularly
encounters with terms in academic translation.</p>
<br />
<h4 id="example-1-on-the-term-mode-in-the-harry-zohn-translation">Example 1: On the term &ldquo;mode&rdquo; in the Harry Zohn translation</h4>
<p>Zohn uses the term &ldquo;mode&rdquo; in two distinct ways in his translation. First, he uses it to characterize translation: &ldquo;Translation is a mode&rdquo; (Zohn, 70). This notion remains fairly mysterious throughout the essay, the word &ldquo;mode&rdquo; scarcely clarifying what it might mean.</p>
<p>Second, Zohn uses &ldquo;mode&rdquo; in relation to the intentions of languages
and words: &ldquo;mode of intention,&rdquo; &ldquo;modes of this intention,&rdquo; &ldquo;these modes&rdquo;
(Zohn, 74).</p>
<p>Given that we have the same word, viz. &ldquo;mode&rdquo;&mdash;used once to characterize
translation, and then in relation to the intentions of languages and
words&mdash;must we, as readers, infer some connection at some level between its two
<em>modes</em> (!) of usage? Whether or not there is a connection between these two instances of &ldquo;mode&rdquo; is thoroughly unclear. One may, consequently, go so far as to
say that this is an instance of bad translation.</p>
<p>Rendall, by contrast, is careful to use two different words in the two
instances: in the Rendall, translation is a &ldquo;form,&rdquo; and it is &ldquo;modes of
<em>meaning</em>&rdquo; that words and languages possess, as opposed to the
Zohnian &ldquo;modes of <em>intention</em>&rdquo; (Rendall, 76, 78; my emphases).</p>
<p>Gandillac&rsquo;s French is similar to the Rendall in using two different words: it uses &ldquo;<em>forme</em>&rdquo;
(Gandillac, 245) in case of the Zohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;mode.&rdquo; And it uses &ldquo;<em>manière de viser</em>&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<em>mode de visée</em>&rdquo; (Gandillac, 251) in case of the Zohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;mode of
intention&rdquo; and the Rendall&rsquo;s &ldquo;mode of meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In light of the above considerations (and others), I, as a reader, chose to use Rendall&rsquo;s translations in my interpretation of Benjamin&rsquo;s essay in English.</p>
<br />
<h4 id="example-2-on-the-terms-signify-mean-intend-and-their-variants-in-the-steven-rendall-translation">Example 2: On the terms &ldquo;signify,&rdquo; &ldquo;mean,&rdquo; &ldquo;intend,&rdquo; and their variants, in the Steven Rendall translation</h4>
<p>In his translation of a passage discussing &ldquo;modes of meaning,&rdquo; Rendall
variously uses &ldquo;mean,&rdquo; &ldquo;signify,&rdquo; and &ldquo;intend,&rdquo; or variants thereof
(Rendall, 78). The differences in <em>meanings</em> (!) of these words is far
from clear, given that they are fairly interchangeable and used in
myriad ways in English academic literature.</p>
<p>In case of the German <em>Sinn</em>, Rendall helpfully specifies in a footnote
that he always translates it as &ldquo;sense&rdquo; and not &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; (Rendall, 83).
He does not include footnotes to explain his usage of &ldquo;mean,&rdquo; &ldquo;signify,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;intend&rdquo; and their variants. Nevertheless, his translation is
coherent and comprehensible since <em><strong>his use of these words manifests discernible patterns</strong></em>. These patterns permit the reader, with a little effort, <em><strong>to draw inferences about the relations between the different words, and thereby arrive at a coherent interpretation of the passage</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Consider the Rendall passage in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the basic laws of the philosophy of language, and to understand it precisely we must distinguish the <strong>mode of meaning</strong> within the intention of <strong>what is meant</strong>. In &ldquo;Brot&rdquo; and &ldquo;pain,&rdquo; <strong>what is meant</strong> is the same, but the <strong>mode of meaning</strong> differs. It is because of the <strong>mode of meaning</strong> that the two words <strong>signify</strong> something different to a German or a Frenchman, that they are not regarded as interchangeable and in fact ultimately seek to exclude one another; however, with respect to their <strong>intended object</strong>, taken absolutely, they <strong>signify</strong> one and the same thing. Thus whereas these two words' <strong>modes of meaning</strong> are in conflict, they complement each other in the two languages from which they stem. And indeed in them the relation between the <em>mode of intention</em> and <strong>what is meant</strong> is complemented. (Rendall, 78; my emphases)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us compare it with the corresponding passage in the Zohn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without distinguishing the <strong>intended object</strong> from the <strong>mode of intention</strong>, no firm grasp of this basic law of a philosophy of language can be achieved. The words <em>Brot</em> and <em>pain</em> <strong>“intend”</strong> the same object, but the <strong>modes of this intention</strong> are not the same. It is owing to these <strong>modes</strong> that the word Brot <strong>means</strong> something different to a German than the word pain to a Frenchman, that these words are not interchangeable for them, that, in fact, they strive to exclude each other. As to <strong>the intended object</strong>, however, the two words <strong>mean</strong> the very same thing. While the <strong>modes of intention</strong> in these two words are in conflict, <strong>intention</strong> and <strong>object of intention</strong> complement each of the two languages from which they are derived; there <strong>the object</strong> is complementary to <strong>the intention</strong>. (Zohn, 74; my emphases)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following are two examples of what I mean by <em>discernible patterns</em> in the Rendall.</p>
<p>First, consider the regularities of word usage in the Rendall: &ldquo;signify&rdquo; is present
exclusively as a verb, none of its other forms being used; &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; appears exclusively in the collocation &ldquo;mode of meaning&rdquo;; &ldquo;meant&rdquo; appears exclusively in the collocation
&ldquo;what is meant&rdquo;; and forms of &ldquo;intend&rdquo; appear exclusively in the use of &ldquo;intention&rdquo; and the collocation &ldquo;intended object&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. This is an instance of what I term a <em><strong>discernible pattern</strong></em>: <em>it helps the reader to relate words, and thereby the concepts they are involved in communicating, despite the fact that the words themselves are vague and very similar</em>.</p>
<p>A glance at the highlighted words in the Zohn suffices to show us that it lacks this regularity of usage.</p>
<p>Second, consider the following two sentence fragments from the Rendall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>because of the mode of meaning &hellip; <em>the two words</em> <strong>signify</strong> <em>something different</em> to a German or a Frenchman (my emphases)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>with respect to their intended object, taken absolutely, they <em>[the two words]</em> <strong>signify</strong> <em>one and the same thing</em> (my emphases)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the following three points regarding these two fragments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The subject is the same in both fragments, viz. the two words <em>Brot</em> and <em>pain</em>.</li>
<li>The word &ldquo;signify&rdquo; is the verb used in both fragments.</li>
<li>The two terms of an opposition appear within the object of the two fragments: in the first sentence, the two words signify something &ldquo;different&rdquo; while in the second, they signify the &ldquo;same&rdquo; thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The discernible pattern here is:</p>
<p><strong>subject [<em>Brot</em>, <em>pain</em>] + verb [<em>signify</em>] + object [involving <em>same/different</em>]</strong></p>
<p>Discerning this pattern allows the reader immediately to search for a
reason for the difference: why does the same pairing of a subject and
verb produce two different results? The reader may then infer that the
first sentence speaks of modes of meaning at the level of words, which
entails that the words signify &ldquo;something different.&rdquo; The second
sentence, by contrast, speaks of the &ldquo;intended object, taken
absolutely,&rdquo; which must then be a different analytical level in the
model. At this analytical level, which the next sentences clarify is
that of languages as wholes, the words signify &ldquo;the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again, a glance at the Zohn passage shows us that such patterning is absent therein.</p>
<p>Thus it is that a clear, coherent, discernible patterning of words in
the translation enables the reader to comprehend the original&rsquo;s message
even when vague and similar words have to be used.</p>
<br />
<h3 id="rules-of-good-academic-translation-practice">Rules of Good Academic Translation Practice</h3>
<h4 id="-rule-1"># Rule 1.</h4>
<p><em><strong>Avoid using the same word within different terms and concepts, unless
the original does so.</strong></em></p>
<p>If it is absolutely necessary to use the same word, use contextual clues
to guide the reader towards the different senses of the word in the
different contexts (<em>see Rule #2 on discernible patterning</em>).</p>
<p>If this is not possible, include a translator&rsquo;s footnote.</p>
<br />
<h4 id="-rule-2"># Rule 2.</h4>
<p>If it is necessary to use similar words, words whose meaning is vague,
or words that are used in myriad ways in academic literature, then
<em><strong>involve the words in discernible patterns of relationships with the words and text surrounding them</strong></em>. The interested reader will then be able to discern
the patterns and use these <em><strong>as a guideline to infer the relationships
between concepts involved</strong></em>.</p>

<p>One is reminded here of the Saussurean conception of language. For
Saussure, the <em>valeur</em> of the signified can only be known at the
systemic level of language as a whole, as different from all the
other <em>valeurs</em> of all the other signifieds within that language
(Saussure 1971: esp. 159). The difference is that, for Saussure,
this <em>valeur</em> can be known within the system of a single language,
independent of other languages. For Benjamin, by contrast, the
intended object is forever hidden within a single language, and can
only emerge when languages complement each other fully.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
