<h1 itemprop="name" id="title">On Benjamin On Translation <em>In</em> Translation, Part II</h1>
<p><em>January 15, 2022</em></p>



<article itemprop="articleBody" id="content">
  <br />
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Never having learnt German, my acquaintance with Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s essay
on translation was initially through the Harry Zohn translation, a
translation that is often pretty but also what one might term
&lsquo;abstruse.&rsquo; It was only upon reading the Steven Rendall translation that
I was finally able to arrive at a coherent and satisfactory interpretation of
Benjamin&rsquo;s essay. For while the Rendall translation is on occasion less
pretty than the Zohn translation, Rendall does, nevertheless, give us a
Benjamin who is incisive and precise, unlike Zohn whose Benjamin is
often lost somewhere along the abstruse-obscure-obscurant cline.
Furthermore, Rendall&rsquo;s translation regularly accords with the wonderful French
translation by Maurice de Gandillac (proofread by Rainer Rochlitz). This
has led me to accept Rendall&rsquo;s as the definitive English translation.</p>
<p>I present here a <strong>critical reading, through a semiotic lens</strong>, of &ldquo;The
Translator&rsquo;s Task.&rdquo; Together with it, I present <strong>comparative notes</strong> on the three translations referenced. The notes focus on the
following three types of academic translation problems:</p>
<p>(a) problems arising in relation to the translation of key terms and
ideas;<br />
(b) the translation of complex chains of anaphoric reference, so
common in philosophical texts;<br />
(c) a reader&rsquo;s worst nightmare: two translations that diverge in
meaning &hellip;</p>
<p>I end with <strong>a set of rules of good practice for academic translation</strong>.
These rules are derived from the critical comparative notes and,
needless to say, my own academic translation practice.</p>
<br />
<h3 id="on-benjamin-on-translation-_in_-translation-part-iibr-_a-reading-of-the-essay-through-a-semiotic-lens_">On Benjamin On Translation <em>In</em> Translation, Part II:<br /><em>A reading of the essay through a semiotic lens</em></h3>
<h4 id="_continued-from_-part-iwalter-benjamin-translators-task-critical-reading-parti">(<em>Continued from</em> <a href="/walter-benjamin-translators-task-critical-reading-parti/">Part I</a>)</h4>
<p>Note that, for the sake of convenience, I shall reference the three
translations of Benjamin&rsquo;s essay using only the name of the translator,
followed by the relevant page number.</p>
<h4 id="the-models-fundamental-postulate">The model&rsquo;s fundamental postulate</h4>
<p>Languages, Benjamin states, are in a state of constant transformation.
In fact, they are growing, and it is a &ldquo;sacred growth,&rdquo; towards the
&ldquo;messianic end of their history&rdquo; (Rendall, 78). It is at this endpoint
that the perfect harmony of the modes of meaning of all languages will
be achieved, all languages complementing each other. And from this
harmony will emerge the intended object, in pure language<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> (Rendall,
78).</p>
<p>This, then, is the teleology of Benjamin&rsquo;s model of language. It
involves a theological assumption, which places the model outside the realm of the
social scientific.</p>
<p>If, Benjamin says, we accept this postulate of the &ldquo;sacred growth&rdquo; of
languages towards the messianic end of their history, then translation
becomes something extremely significant. For translation, he says, can
test that sacred growth of languages, to determine how distant the
intended object, hidden within an individual language, is from its
revelation.</p>
<h4 id="on-the-indexical-iconicity-of-translation">On the indexical iconicity of translation</h4>
<p>Benjamin writes of translation that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In translation, the original develops into a linguistic sphere that is both higher and purer&hellip; it points at least, in a wonderfully penetrating manner, toward the predetermined, inaccessible domain where languages are reconciled and fulfilled. (Rendall, 79)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benjamin terms the language of translation the &ldquo;language of truth &ndash; the
true language&rdquo; (Rendall, 80).</p>
<p>How does the translation attain a &ldquo;higher and purer&rdquo; linguistic sphere
than the original literary work? How is the language of translation
&ldquo;true&rdquo;? And what would the difference be between the &ldquo;true language&rdquo; of translation and &ldquo;pure language&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The &ldquo;intention&rdquo; of the original literary work, Benjamin states, is only
ever directed &ldquo;toward certain linguistic ways of structuring content,&rdquo;
never towards language as a whole (Rendall, 79-80). The translation&rsquo;s
&ldquo;intention,&rdquo; by contrast, starts from a single work of art, but is
directed towards a language as a whole, that is, the language into which
the work is to be translated. Benjamin sketches the metaphor of the
&ldquo;forest of language&rdquo; to discuss this: the original literary work lies in
the middle of such a forest of its own language. The translation, by
contrast, remains outside, facing this forest. From this position,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the translation calls to the original within, at that one point where the echo can produce in its own language a reverberation of the work in the foreign language (Rendall, 80)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rather abstruse metaphor may be understood as follows: the
translation calls to the original at the center of its &ldquo;language forest&rdquo;
(Zohn, 76). Its call produces an echo, that is, in the language of the
translation. If the translation&rsquo;s call falls at precisely the right
point with respect to the original literary work, then its echo reverberates through
the original&rsquo;s language forest. The metaphor of this reverberation, of
the echo in the language of translation within the language forest of
the original, accords with Benjamin&rsquo;s notion of the complementing of
languages&rsquo; intentions, and the harmony of the modes of meaning of languages.</p>
<p>This, then, is a key aspect of what I term translation&rsquo;s indexical
iconicity in this model: this reverberation, of translation&rsquo;s echo
within the original&rsquo;s language forest, is <em>iconic</em> of that harmony of modes of meaning of all
languages that will reveal pure language at the messianic end of
languages&rsquo; history. Simultaneously, the &ldquo;true language&rdquo; of translation
is <em>indexical</em> of that &ldquo;pure language&rdquo; that will be revealed at languages&rsquo; messianic end time. This,
then, is the sense in which translation&rsquo;s language is &ldquo;true.&rdquo; This, then, is how translation relates to the original literary work, and occupies a higher and purer linguistic realm than the latter.</p>

<br />
<h3 id="a-comparative-critique-of-the-three-translationsbr-_considering-terms-in-translation_">A Comparative Critique of the Three Translations:<br /><em>Considering terms in translation</em></h3>
<p>I present here an example of a third type of problem one encounters
with terms in academic translation.</p>
<p>(See <a href="/walter-benjamin-translators-task-critical-reading-parti/"><strong>Part I</strong></a> for a discussion of
examples of two other types of terminological problems in academic
translation.)</p>
<br />
<h4 id="example-3-on-the-notion-of-messianic-in-benjamins-model-of-language">Example 3: on the notion of &ldquo;messianic&rdquo; in Benjamin&rsquo;s model of language</h4>
<p>Consider first the Zohn translation of Benjamin&rsquo;s discussion of how
languages grow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the individual, unsupplemented languages, meaning is never found in relative independence, as in individual words or sentences; rather, it is in a constant state of flux&mdash;until it is able to emerge as pure language from the harmony of all the various modes of intention. Until then, it remains hidden in the languages. If, however, these languages continue to grow in this manner <em><strong>until the end of their time</strong></em>, it is translation which catches fire on the eternal life of the works and the perpetual renewal of language. Translation keeps putting the <em><strong>hallowed growth of languages</strong></em> to the test: How far removed is their hidden meaning from <em><strong>revelation</strong></em>, how close can it be brought by the knowledge of this remoteness? (Zohn, 74-75; emphases added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider next Rendall&rsquo;s translation of this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the individual, uncomplemented languages, the intended object never occurs in relative independence, for instance in individual words or sentences, but is rather caught up in constant transformation, until it is able to emerge as pure language from the harmony of all these modes of meaning. Until then it remains hidden in the various languages. But if languages grow in this way until they reach <strong><em>the messianic end of their history</em></strong>, then it is translation that is ignited by the eternal continuing life of the works and the endless revival of languages in order to constantly test <em><strong>this sacred growth of languages</strong></em>, to determine how distant what is hidden within them is from <em><strong>revelation</strong></em>, how present it might become in the knowledge of this distance. (Rendall, 78; emphases added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, consider the Gandillac translation of the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dans les langues prises une à une et donc incomplètes, ce qu&rsquo;elles visent ne peut jamais être atteint de façon relativement autonome, comme dans les mots ou les phrases pris séparément, mais est soumis à une mutation constante, jusqu&rsquo;à ce qu&rsquo;il soit en état de ressortir, comme langage pur, de l&rsquo;harmonie de tous ces modes de visée. Jusqu&rsquo;alors il reste dissimulé dans les langues. Mais, lorsqu&rsquo;elles croissent de la sorte</em> <strong>jusqu&rsquo;au terme messianique de leur histoire</strong>, <em>c&rsquo;est à la traduction, qui tire sa flamme de l&rsquo;éternelle survie des œuvres et de la renaissance indéfinie des langues, qu&rsquo;il appartient de mettre toujours derechef à l&rsquo;épreuve</em> <strong>cette sainte croissance des langues</strong>, <em>pour savoir à quelle distance de</em> <strong>la Révélation</strong> <em>se tient ce qu&rsquo;elles dissimulent, combien il peut devenir présent dans le savoir de cette distance.</em> (Gandillac, 251; emphases added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we see in the three translations of this passage is that two&mdash;viz.
the Rendall and the Gandillac&mdash;include the term &ldquo;messianic&rdquo;
(&quot;<em>messianique</em>&quot; in French). The third, viz. the Zohn, does not include
this term.</p>
<p>Now, as it so happens, the notion of the &ldquo;messianic&rdquo; in the end of
languages&rsquo; history is crucial to understanding Benjamin&rsquo;s model of
language, as was discussed above: the term communicates clearly the theological
nature of the teleology of Benjamin&rsquo;s model, culminating as it does in
the revelation of pure language at this messianic end of languages&rsquo;
history. Zohn&rsquo;s translation, quite inexplicably, does not include this
term, speaking only of languages&rsquo; &ldquo;hallowed growth&rdquo; until &ldquo;the end of
their time.&rdquo; The Zohn does use the term &ldquo;revelation&rdquo; but it is included
in rather a subtle fashion, speaking of how &ldquo;far removed &hellip; their
hidden meaning [is] from revelation.&rdquo; In the absence of the term
&ldquo;messianic,&rdquo; it is rather unclear that the growth of languages is
hallowed precisely in the sense that it is a growth towards revelation,
that is, the revelation of pure language. The mere inclusion of the term
&ldquo;messianic&rdquo; clarifies the model immediately.</p>
<br />
<h3 id="rules-of-good-academic-translation-practice">Rules of Good Academic Translation Practice</h3>
<h4 id="-rule-3"># Rule 3.</h4>
<p><em><strong>Include key terms explicitly, especially when they are crucial to communicating the sense of the original.</strong></em></p>
<p>As mentioned, the reader innocent of a knowledge of German has no way of knowing why Zohn omits the term
&ldquo;messianic,&rdquo; and only knows that it is included in both the Rendall and
the Gandillac.</p>
<p><em><strong>If, for whatever reason, a key term must be left out&mdash;perhaps it is only implicit in the original text, for instance&mdash;then include a translator&rsquo;s footnote explaining that implicit meaning which would not otherwise be clear to the reader.</strong></em></p>
