<h1 itemprop="name" id="title">On Benjamin On Translation <em>In</em> Translation, Part III</h1>
<p><em>February 1, 2022</em></p>



<article itemprop="articleBody" id="content">
  <br />
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Never having learnt German, my acquaintance with Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s essay
on translation was initially through the Harry Zohn translation, a
translation that is often pretty but also what one might term
&lsquo;abstruse.&rsquo; It was only upon reading the Steven Rendall translation that
I was finally able to arrive at a coherent and satisfactory interpretation of
Benjamin&rsquo;s essay. For while the Rendall translation is on occasion less
pretty than the Zohn translation, Rendall does, nevertheless, give us a
Benjamin who is incisive and precise, unlike Zohn whose Benjamin is
often lost somewhere along the abstruse-obscure-obscurant cline.
Furthermore, Rendall&rsquo;s translation regularly accords with the wonderful French
translation by Maurice de Gandillac (proofread by Rainer Rochlitz). This
has led me to accept Rendall&rsquo;s as the definitive English translation.</p>
<p>I present here a <strong>critical reading, through a semiotic lens</strong>, of &ldquo;The
Translator&rsquo;s Task.&rdquo; Together with it, I present <strong>comparative notes</strong> on the three translations referenced. The notes focus on the
following three types of academic translation problems:</p>
<p>(a) problems arising in relation to the translation of key terms and
ideas;<br />
(b) the translation of complex chains of anaphoric reference, so
common in philosophical texts;<br />
(c) a reader&rsquo;s worst nightmare: two translations that diverge in
meaningÂ &hellip;</p>
<p>I end with <strong>a set of rules of good practice for academic translation</strong>.
These rules are derived from the critical comparative notes and,
needless to say, my own academic translation practice.</p>
<br />

<h4 id="_continued-from_-part-iwalter-benjamin-translators-task-critical-reading-parti-and-part-iiwalter-benjamin-translators-task-critical-reading-partii">(<em>Continued from</em> <a href="/walter-benjamin-translators-task-critical-reading-parti/">Part I</a> and <a href="/walter-benjamin-translators-task-critical-reading-partii/">Part II</a>)</h4>
<p>Note that, for the sake of convenience, I shall reference the three
translations of Benjamin&rsquo;s essay using only the name of the translator,
followed by the relevant page number.</p>
<h4 id="the-task-of-the-translator-fidelity-and-freedom-in-translation">The task of the translator: fidelity and freedom in translation</h4>
<p>Another aspect of translation&rsquo;s indexical iconicity is more familiar,
relating to the &ldquo;reproduction of the sense&rdquo; (Rendall, 80) of the
original work. Traditional notions of fidelity demand that the
translation reproduce&mdash;iconize&mdash;the sense of the original. In doing
so, the translation is then also an index of that original, pointing to
it as such.</p>
<p>Benjamin, however, has a somewhat different conception of fidelity in
translation. For Benjamin, both the sense and the poetic significance of
the original literary work depend on the particular elements&mdash;&ldquo;words,
sentences, structures&rdquo;&mdash;of its own language. Note that, for Benjamin,
the poetic significance of the original lies not merely in the meanings
of its words but &ldquo;is rather achieved &hellip; through the way in which what is meant is bound up with the mode of meaning in the particular word&rdquo; (Rendall, 80).</p>
<p>How must this sense and its poetic significance be reproduced in
translation? What does fidelity mean here? What, in other words, is the
translator&rsquo;s task?</p>
<p>Benjamin uses the metaphor of the &ldquo;fragments of a vessel&rdquo; that must be
fitted together to reproduce the vessel: the fragments need not resemble
each other. What is needed is that they &ldquo;correspond to each other in the
minutest details,&rdquo; for the vase to be fitted together anew (Rendall,
81). Similarly, translation must:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fashion in its own language, carefully and in detail, a counterpart to the original&rsquo;s mode of meaning, in order to make both of them recognizable as fragments of a vessel, <em>as fragments of a greater language</em> (Ibid., emphases added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simply put, fidelity in translation dictates that the latter must index pure
language.</p>
<p>Benjamin&rsquo;s notion of freedom in translation is similarly conditioned by
his conception of pure language: it is the translator&rsquo;s task to set free
in her own language &ldquo;the pure language spellbound in the foreign
language, to liberate the language imprisoned in the work by rewriting
it&rdquo; (Rendall, 82). The extent of such possible liberation of the
language imprisoned in the original depends on that original itself. We
turn therefore to a consideration of the types of literary works that
are, for Benjamin, &ldquo;translatable.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id="the-original-literary-work-in-benjamins-model">The original literary work in Benjamin&rsquo;s model</h4>
<p>We have noted that Benjamin focuses on great literary oeuvres. These
works possess what he terms &ldquo;translatability&rdquo; (Rendall, 76, etc.); they
call for their own translation. This is, no doubt, in consonance with
the sacred growth of languages towards their messianic end: great works
must be thus translatable for true translations to be able to test
regularly the state of growth of languages and their distance from the ultimate revelation of pure language.</p>
<p>The translatability of the original depends on the &ldquo;value and dignity&rdquo;
of the original&rsquo;s language (Rendall, 82-83). To put it telegraphically,
the value and dignity of an original&rsquo;s language is inversely
proportional to the degree to which it is laden with sense, that is, with a
message that must be communicated. (One may think of non-literary,
pragmatic texts to understand Benjamin&rsquo;s point here.) For if an original
is heavy with sense, with a message that must be reproduced in
translation, then its translation is weighed down by that sense
reproduction, weighed down within the modes of meaning of the particular
elements of the language of the translation&mdash;its &ldquo;words, sentences,
structures&rdquo;&mdash;that are required to construct anew that sense, that
message, in the language of translation<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The echo of such a translation and its
reverberations would die out rapidly in the face of the weight, as it
were, of this sense to be reproduced. The translator of such an
original is consequently distracted from her true task and the <em>raison d&rsquo;Ãªtre</em> of translation, namely, the
indexical iconization of pure language. This is why, for Benjamin, such
originals are low in value and dignity.</p>

<h3 id="a-comparative-critique-of-the-three-translationsbr-_on-translating-long-chains-of-anaphoric-reference_">A Comparative Critique of the Three Translations:<br /><em>On translating long chains of anaphoric reference</em></h3>
<p>(See <a href="/walter-benjamin-translators-task-critical-reading-parti/">Part I</a> and <a href="/walter-benjamin-translators-task-critical-reading-partii/">Part II</a> for a discussion of terminological problems that regularly crop up in academic translation.)</p>
<p>I present here a discussion of the difficulty of translating anaphoric
chains of reference, regularly encountered in philosophical but also
other genres of academic writing. English deictic forms do not
communicate much information. Think of the terse English &ldquo;it&rdquo; as opposed
to its equivalent, far more forthcoming French forms &ndash;
<em>celle-ci/ celui-ci/ celles-ci/ ceux-ci</em>, for instance, which are marked
for both gender and number, thereby permitting much longer chains of
anaphora with far greater textual distances between anaphor and
referent, even quite comfortably accommodating multiple anaphoric chains
within a single sentence.</p>
<p>Let us consider first Zohn&rsquo;s version of a somewhat involved sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the <strong>word <em>Brot</em></strong> means something different to <em>a German</em> than the <strong>word <em>pain</em></strong> to <em>a Frenchman</em>, that <strong>these words</strong> are not interchangeable for <em>them</em>, that, in fact, <strong>they</strong> strive to exclude each other. (Zohn, 74; emphases added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zohn&rsquo;s attempt here is to keep two distinct anaphoric chains in play in a
single sentence. The first chain is bolded, its referents being the
<strong>two words <em>Brot</em> and <em>pain</em></strong>, followed by two anaphoric references
(<strong>these words</strong>, <strong>they</strong>). The second chain&rsquo;s referents are the
<em>German</em> and the <em>Frenchman</em>, followed by a single anaphora
(<em>them</em>)&mdash;found bang in the middle of the first anaphoric chain!
Certainly, the passage ends up being comprehensible, but it makes for an
effortful read.</p>
<p>Is there a better way of handling this, a way that is less taxing to the
reader?</p>
<p>We turn to the corresponding sentence in the Rendall, which has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In <strong>&ldquo;Brot&rdquo; and &ldquo;pain,&rdquo;</strong> what is meant is the same, but the mode of meaning differs. It is because of the mode of meaning that <strong>the two words</strong> signify something different to <em>a German or a Frenchman</em>, that <strong>they</strong> are not regarded as interchangeable and in fact ultimately seek to exclude one another &hellip; (Rendall, 78; emphases added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rendall does it with only one chain of anaphoric reference, viz. that
pertaining to the <strong>two words <em>Brot</em> and <em>pain</em></strong>, followed by two
anaphoric referents (<strong>the two words</strong>, <strong>they</strong>). The sentences are
structured such that the German and the Frenchman do not require any
anaphoric reference. This is far more elegant, far easier for the reader
to understand.</p>
<p>But, one might persist in one&rsquo;s defense of the Zohn, perhaps Zohn was attempting to remain faithful to
something in the original. To consider this, we turn to the corresponding sentences
offered us by the French Gandillac translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dans <strong>Â«BrotÂ» et Â«painÂ»,</strong> le visÃ© est assurÃ©ment le mÃªme, mais non la maniÃ¨re de le viser. Car en raison de ce mode de visÃ©e <strong>les deux mots</strong> signifient quelque chose de diffÃ©rent pour</em> <strong>l&rsquo;Allemand et le FranÃ§ais</strong>, <em>ne sont pas pour</em> <strong>eux</strong> <em>interchangeables et mÃªme, en fin de compte, tendent Ã  <strong>s&rsquo;exclure l&rsquo;un l&rsquo;autre</strong> ...</em> (Gandillac, 251; emphases added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gandillac&rsquo;s French thus involves two anaphoric chains of reference like
the Zohn. Nevertheless, the structure is quite different: the second chain is
extremely short, viz. that involving the referent of the German and Frenchman
(<em>l&rsquo;Allemand et le FranÃ§ais</em>), and the single anaphor (<em>eux</em>). Here the
anaphor&rsquo;s reference is clear since it is the closest to its referent within the
text. There is no crisscrossing of the two anaphoric chains either. Instead, the short chain is embedded within the longer one.</p>
<p>Structurally, the relative positionings of the two sets of
referents and their anaphora in the French are clearly closer to the Rendall than to the Zohn. The case for Zohn&rsquo;s fidelity to the original would
thus seem rather weak.</p>
<p>In sum, Rendall&rsquo;s translation proves superior yet again to the Zohn: it
avoids multiple, crisscrossing chains of anaphoric reference that can be
quite taxing to the English&mdash;or, indeed, any&mdash;reader, particularly in light of the fact that English anaphora
tend to be sparing in the information they communicate.</p>
<br />
<h3 id="rules-of-good-academic-translation-practice">Rules of Good Academic Translation Practice</h3>
<p>(See <a href="/walter-benjamin-translators-task-critical-reading-parti/">Part I</a> and <a href="/walter-benjamin-translators-task-critical-reading-partii/">Part II</a> for <strong>rules 1-3.</strong>)</p>
<p><strong># Rule 4.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(4a) <em>The translation&rsquo;s chains of anaphoric reference must reflect those of the original accurately. Nevertheless, the different grammatical requirements of the two languages must be taken into account when constructing those chains in the target text.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>(4b) <em>In case of long anaphoric chains in the original text, the academic translator&rsquo;s task is to interpret the original, and to recast the anaphors in the target text, re-stating the referent as and when required.</em></strong></p>
<p>Such insertions of the referent in the target language may well entail
that the translated text is fundamentally <em>an interpretation by the
translator</em>. This interpretation, and thereby the translation, must be
consistent, with a view to permitting the reader to understand the
referent, whether through a study of the chain itself, or by virtue of other clues
furnished in the chain&rsquo;s context, that is, in the contents of the text.</p>
