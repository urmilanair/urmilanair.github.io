<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Never having learnt German, my acquaintance with Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s essay
on translation was initially through the Harry Zohn translation, a
translation that is often pretty but also what one might term
&lsquo;abstruse.&rsquo; It was only upon reading the Steven Rendall translation that
I was finally able to arrive at a coherent and satisfactory interpretation of
Benjamin&rsquo;s essay. For while the Rendall translation is on occasion less
pretty than the Zohn translation, Rendall does, nevertheless, give us a
Benjamin who is incisive and precise, unlike Zohn whose Benjamin is
often lost somewhere along the abstruse-obscure-obscurant cline.
Furthermore, Rendall&rsquo;s translation regularly accords with the wonderful French
translation by Maurice de Gandillac (proofread by Rainer Rochlitz). This
has led me to accept Rendall&rsquo;s as the definitive English translation.</p>
<p>I present here a <strong>critical reading, through a semiotic lens</strong>, of &ldquo;The
Translator&rsquo;s Task.&rdquo; Together with it, I present <strong>comparative notes</strong> on the three translations referenced. The notes focus on the
following three types of academic translation problems:</p>
<p>(a) problems arising in relation to the translation of key terms and
ideas;<br />
(b) the translation of complex chains of anaphoric reference, so
common in philosophical texts;<br />
(c) a reader&rsquo;s worst nightmare: two translations that diverge in
meaning &hellip;</p>
<p>I end with <strong>a set of rules of good practice for academic translation</strong>.
These rules are derived from the critical comparative notes and,
needless to say, my own academic translation practice.</p>

<p>Note that, for the sake of convenience, I shall reference the three
translations of Benjamin&rsquo;s essay using only the name of the translator,
followed by the relevant page number.</p>
<h4 id="the-translation-of-the-holy-scriptures---the-ideal-of-all-translation">The translation of the Holy Scriptures&mdash;the ideal of all translation</h4>
<p>The works of greatest value and dignity, Benjamin avers, are the Holy
Scriptures. These are &ldquo;unconditionally translatable&rdquo; and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>just as language and revelation must be united in the text, literalness and freedom must be united in the form of an interlinear translation. (Rendall, 83)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This interlinear translation of the Holy Scriptures is, Benjamin says,
the ideal of all translation.</p>
<p>I interpret this as follows: in the Holy Scriptures, where &ldquo;the text
belongs immediately to truth,&rdquo; translation is freed from the need to
iconically reproduce the sense of the original in a different language.
Interlinear translation is, therefore, precisely the form that lends
itself to this type of translation. For it does not seek to reproduce
the original&rsquo;s sense in reliance on the particular elements of a
different language. The interlinear translation of Holy Scriptures is
thus truly and wholly indexically iconic of pure language, without the
distraction of mere sense reproduction of the original text in the
translation&rsquo;s language.</p>
<p>Of relevance here is Benjamin&rsquo;s discussion of the difference between
words and sentences in the true language of a translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>True translation is transparent: it does not obscure the original, does not stand in its light, but rather allows pure language, as if strengthened by its own medium, to shine even more fully on the original. This is made possible primarily by conveying the syntax word-for-word; and this demonstrates that the word, not the sentence, is translation&rsquo;s original element. For the sentence is the wall in front of the language of the original, and word-for-word rendering the arcade. (Rendall, 81)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benjamin asserts here that &ldquo;the word, not the sentence, is translation&rsquo;s
original element&rdquo;: the sentence is a &ldquo;wall in front of the original&rdquo;
while the &ldquo;word-for-word rendering&rdquo; is an arcade.</p>
<p>I understand this as follows: the sentence consists in words that are
bound up in the structures of the language. The sentence is thus rigid,
as it were, with the modes of meaning specific to the language at the
level of its particular elements. It, therefore, serves well to
reproduce the sense of sentences within an original work. Words, by
contrast, if treated individually, are more tractable, easily separated,
broken up, to reveal the structure of the sentence behind the overall
sense that the latter constructs. This is why a &ldquo;word-for-word
rendering&rdquo; is like an arcade: it allows light to shine through upon the
original and indexes the original in a more transparent fashion than a
sentence-by-sentence rendering would. This is why an interlinear
translation, a &ldquo;word-for-word rendering,&rdquo; of the Holy Scriptures is, for
Benjamin, the ideal translation.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>To recapitulate then: the &ldquo;true language&rdquo; of translation is an indexical
icon of &ldquo;pure language.&rdquo; It iconizes that future harmony of modes of
meaning of all languages that will be attained at the messianic end of
the history of languages, from which will emerge, in all its glory, the
intended object. Translation <em>iconizes</em> that harmony with its &ldquo;true
language&rdquo; that emerges in the reverberation of translation&rsquo;s echo within
the language forest of the original literary work. Translation also
<em>indexes</em> that harmony and pure language, just as a fragment of the
broken vessel indexes the whole vessel that is to be fitted together.</p>
<p>Of interest to social scientists and theoreticians of translation is
this idea of <em>translation as an</em> <em>indexical icon</em>. For Benjamin, it
indexically iconizes pure language. However, Benjamin&rsquo;s assumption of a
theological teleology may be supplanted by a different, social
scientific assumption. One may forego the notion of sacred growth and a
messianic end to languages&rsquo; history. One may choose instead an
assumption that is valid within the realm of the social scientific, for
instance, that languages possess an underlying or immanent structure,
akin to Saussurean structure, that may be studied &ldquo;constructively, that
is, empirically and pragmatically&rdquo; (Silverstein 2000: 108-109; 2003:
esp. 76-77 for a summary).</p>
<p>I suggest, in sum, that the idea of <em>translation as an indexical icon of
some higher or deeper form of language</em>, an idea inspired by Benjamin&rsquo;s
essay, is &ldquo;good to think with&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="_a-readers-worst-nightmare---when-translations-diverge-in-their-meaning-_"><em>A reader&rsquo;s worst nightmare&mdash;when translations diverge in their meaning &hellip;</em></h3>
<p>It turns out that the Zohn and Rendall translations of the passage are
<em>saying different things</em> at two points in at least one key passage.</p>
<p>The Zohn translation of the passage is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without <strong>distinguishing the intended object from the mode of intention</strong>, no firm grasp of this basic law of a philosophy of language can be achieved. The words <em>Brot</em> and <em>pain</em> &ldquo;intend&rdquo; the same object, but the modes of this intention are not the same. It is owing to these modes that the word <em>Brot</em> means something different to a German than the word <em>pain</em> to a Frenchman, that these words are not interchangeable for them, that, in fact, they strive to exclude each other. As to the intended object, however, the two words mean the very same thing. <strong>While the modes of intention in these two words are in conflict, intention and object of intention complement each of the two languages from which they are derived; there the object is complementary to the intention</strong>. (Zohn, 74; emphases added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Rendall reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the basic laws of the philosophy of language, and to understand it precisely <strong>we must distinguish the mode of meaning within the intention of what is meant</strong>. In &ldquo;Brot&rdquo; and &ldquo;pain,&rdquo; what is meant is the same, but the mode of meaning differs. It is because of the mode of meaning that the two words signify something different to a German or a Frenchman, that they are not regarded as interchangeable and in fact ultimately seek to exclude one another; however, with respect to their intended object, taken absolutely, they signify one and the same thing. <strong>Thus whereas these two words&rsquo; modes of meaning are in conflict, they complement each other in the two languages from which they stem. And indeed in them the relation between the <em>mode of intention</em> and what is meant is complemented</strong>. (Rendall, 78; emphases added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, at the beginning of the passage, the Rendall translation states
that, to understand the basic law of a philosophy of language under
consideration, it is necessary to &ldquo;distinguish the mode of meaning
within the intention of what is meant [= the intended object].&rdquo; In
effect, the Rendall seems to state here that the mode of meaning must be
distinguished within the &lsquo;intention of the intended object.&rsquo; What is the
&rsquo;the intention of the intended object&rsquo; in Benjamin? This is unclear and
sounds strange since elsewhere in the essay, it is words and languages
that intend; the intended object does not itself intend ever.</p>
<p>The Zohn translation, by contrast, speaks of &ldquo;distinguishing the
intended object from the mode of intention,&rdquo; so as to understand that
law of the philosophy of language. This too is unclear: as was
mentioned, words and languages intend an object, that is then the
intended object. It is not clear, therefore, where distinguishing (a
mode of) intention and its object would get us. The rest of the text
that follows does not elucidate this either.</p>
<p>We thus have&mdash;horror of horrors&mdash;two translations that apparently
diverge in their meaning, and that are, additionally, thoroughly
unclear. In other words, <em>the two translations are irreconcilable, and each is irresolvable</em>!</p>
<p>Second, at the end of the passage, the Rendall translation states that
in languages, &ldquo;the relation between the mode of intention and what is
meant is complemented.&rdquo; I take this to mean that, at the level of
languages as wholes, the relationship of the &ldquo;mode of intention&rdquo; and the
intended object in one language is complemented by other such
relationships in other languages. One problem here is that this is <em>the
only occasion on which the Rendall uses the term</em> &ldquo;mode of intention.&rdquo;
This term thus remains completely opaque in the absence of any patterns
of its usage, raising the questions: what would the difference be
between a &ldquo;mode of intention&rdquo; and an &ldquo;intention&rdquo; of a language? What is
the difference between &ldquo;mode of intention&rdquo; and &ldquo;mode of meaning&rdquo;? To
which no answers are furnished: <em>in the absence of discernible patterns of usage, it is impossible to infer anything about the term &ldquo;mode of intention.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Zohn translation here states something that looks very different: on
the one hand, the &ldquo;intention and object of intention <em>complement each of
the two languages</em> from which they are derived&rdquo; (emphases added). On the
other, &ldquo;the object is <em>complementary</em> to the intention&rdquo; (my emphases).
The Zohn thus offers not one but <em>two</em> notions of complementarity.
Furthermore, neither of the two bears any resemblance to the Rendall on
this point. <em>The two translations are, once more, irreconcilable, and each is irresolvable!</em></p>
<p>The two English translations thus leave the reader in a quandary. Why do
they differ? Which one communicates better Benjamin&rsquo;s message? The
reader turns to the French translation in the hope of solace. The
corresponding passage in the Gandillac translation reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pour saisir exactement cette loi, une des lois fondamentales de la philosophie du langage,</em> <strong><em>il faut, à l&rsquo;intérieur de l&rsquo;intention, distinguer ce qui est visé de la manière dont on le vise</em></strong>. <em>Dans «Brot» et «pain», le visé est assurément le même, mais non la manière de le viser. Car en raison de ce mode de visée les deux mots signifient quelque chose de différent pour l&rsquo;Allemand et le Français, ne sont pas pour eux interchangeables et même, en fin de compte, tendent à s&rsquo;exclure l&rsquo;un l&rsquo;autre, alors que, pour ce qui concerne le visé, pris absolument, ils signifient une seule et même chose.</em> <strong><em>Tandis que la manière de viser est en opposition dans ces deux mots, elle se complète dans les deux langues d&rsquo;où ils proviennent. En elles, en effet, se complète</em> la manière de viser, <em>pour constituer le visé</em></strong>. (Gandillac, 251)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To begin with the second problem, the one occurring at the end of the
passage: where the Rendall has &ldquo;mode of intention,&rdquo; the Gandillac has
&ldquo;<em>manière de viser</em>,&rdquo; which is uniformly the equivalent of Rendall&rsquo;s
&ldquo;mode of meaning.&rdquo; <em>Is &ldquo;mode of intention&rdquo; then merely a horrible typographic error in the Rendall translation</em>? This is what I assume in my interpretation adopted above.</p>
<p>Next consider the problem at the start of the passage: what is it that
needs to be distinguished in order to understand that basic law of a
philosophy of language? The Gandillac states, effectively, that in
languages, modes of meaning <em>complement</em> each other to constitute the
intended object.</p>
<p>The Randall, recall, gives us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we must distinguish the mode of meaning within the intention of what is meant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, in accordance with the Gandillac, <em>should</em> read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we must distinguish the mode of meaning, within the intention, <del>of</del> <strong>from</strong> what is meant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word &ldquo;of&rdquo; must be replaced by &ldquo;from,&rdquo; and we need to throw in two
commas for good measure. Once this is done, the Rendall matches the
Gandillac, God&rsquo;s in his heaven, all&rsquo;s right with the world!</p>
